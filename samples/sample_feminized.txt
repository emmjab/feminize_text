The study of paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which she will later practice. Because she there joins women who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, her subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. Women whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, i.e., for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition.
