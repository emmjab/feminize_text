At that time I was a \ngraduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end \nof my dissertation. A fortunate involvement with an experimental \ncollege course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided \nmy first exposure to the history of science. To my complete surprise, that \nexposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically \nundermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science \nand the reasons for its special success. \n\nThose conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from \nscientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational \ninterest in the philosophy of science. Somehow, whatever their \npedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at \nall fit the enterprise that historical study displayed. Yet they were and \nare fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of \nverisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing. The result \nwas a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of \nscience and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical \nproblems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led \nme to history. Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my \npublished works in which these early concerns are dominant. In some \npart it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened \nto be drawn from science to its history in the first place. \n\nMy first opportunity to pursue in depth some of the ideas set forth \nbelow was provided by three years as a Junior Fellow of the Society of \nFellows of Harvard University. Without that period of freedom the \ntransition to a new field of study would have been far more difficult and \nmight not have been achieved. Part of my time in those years was \ndevoted to history of science proper. In particular I continued to study \nthe writings of Alex- \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2  \nv \n\n\n\nPreface \n \n\nandre Koyr\u00e9 and first encountered those of Emile Meyerson, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne \nMetzger, and Anneliese Maier.1 More clearly than most other recent \nscholars, this group has shown what it was like to think scientifically in a \nperiod when the canons of scientific thought were very different from \nthose current today. Though I increasingly question a few of their \nparticular historical interpretations, their works, together with A. O. \nLovejoy\u2019s Great Chain of Being, have been second only to primary source \nmaterials in shaping my conception of what the history of scientific \nideas can be. \n\nMuch of my time in those years, however, was spent exploring fields \nwithout apparent relation to history of science but in which research \nnow discloses problems like the ones history was bringing to my \nattention. A footnote encountered by chance led me to the experiments \nby which Jean Piaget has illuminated both the various worlds of the \ngrowing child and the process of transition from one to the next.2 One of \nmy colleagues set me to reading papers in the psychology of perception, \nparticularly the Gestalt psychologists; another introduced me to B. L. \nWhorf\u2019s speculations about the effect of language on world view; and W. \nV. O. Quine opened for me the philosophical puzzles of the analytic-\nsynthetic distinction.3 That is the sort of random exploration that the \nSociety of Fellows permits, and only through it could I have encountered \nLudwik Fleck\u2019s almost unknown monograph, Entstehung und \nEntwicklung einer wis- \n\n \n1 Particularly influential were Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, \u00c9tudes Galil\u00e9ennes (3 vols.; \nParis, 1939); Emile Meyerson, Identity and Reality, trans. Kate Loewenberg (New \nYork, 1930); H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Metzger, Les doctrines chimiques en France du d\u00e9but du XVIIe \u00e0 \nla fin du XVIIIe si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1923), and Newton, Stahl, Boerhaave et la doctrine \nchimique (Paris, 1930); and Anneliese Maier, Die Vorl\u00e4ufer Galileis im 14. \nJahrhundert (\u201cStudien zur Naturphilosophie der Sp\u00e4tscholastik\u201d; Rome, 1949). \n2 Because they displayed concepts and processes that also emerge directly from \nthe history of science, two sets of Piaget s investigations proved particularly \nimportant: The Child\u2019s Conception of Causality, trans. Marjorie Gabain (London, \n1930), and Les notions de mouvement et de vitesse chez l\u2019enfant (Paris, 1946). \n3  Whorf\u2019s papers have since been collected by John B. Carroll, Language, \nThought, and Reality\u2014Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf (New York, 1956). \nQuine has presented his views in \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism,\u201d reprinted in his \nFrom a Logical Point of View (Cambridge, Mass., 1953), pp. 20-46. \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \nvi \n\n\n\nPreface \n \n\nsenschaftlichen Tatsache (Basel, 1935), an essay that anticipates many of \nmy own ideas. Together with a remark from another Junior Fellow, \nFrancis X. Sutton, Fleck\u2019s work made me realize that those ideas might \nrequire to be set in the sociology of the scientific community. Though \nreaders will find few references to either these works or conversations \nbelow, I am indebted to them in more ways than I can now reconstruct \nor evaluate. \n\nDuring my last year as a Junior Fellow, an invitation to lecture for the \nLowell Institute in Boston provided a first chance to try out my still \ndeveloping notion of science. The result was a series of eight public \nlectures, delivered during March, 1951, on \u201cThe Quest for Physical \nTheory.\u201d In the next year I began to teach history of science proper, and \nfor almost a decade the problems of instructing in a field I had never \nsystematically studied left little time for explicit articulation of the ideas \nthat had first brought me to it. Fortunately, however, those ideas proved \na source of implicit orientation and of some problem-structure for much \nof my more advanced teaching. I therefore have my students to thank \nfor invaluable lessons both about the viability of my views and about the \ntechniques appropriate to their effective communication. The same \nproblems and orientation give unity to most of the dominantly \nhistorical, and apparently diverse, studies I have published since the end \nof my fellowship. Several of them deal with the integral part played by \none or another metaphysic in creative scientific research. Others \nexamine the way in which the experimental bases of a new theory are \naccumulated and assimilated by men committed to an incompatible \nolder theory. In the process they describe the type of development that I \nhave below called the \u201cemergence\u201d of a new theory or discovery. There \nare other such ties besides. \n\nThe final stage in the development of this essay began with an \ninvitation to spend the year 1958-59 at the Center for Advanced Studies \nin the Behavioral Sciences. Once again I was able to give undivided \nattention to the problems discussed below. Even more important, \nspending the year in a community \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \nvii \n\n\n\nPreface \n \n\ncomposed predominantly of social scientists confronted me with \nunanticipated problems about the differences between such \ncommunities and those of the natural scientists among whom I had \nbeen trained. Particularly, I was struck by the number and extent of the \novert disagreements between social scientists about the nature of \nlegitimate scientific problems and methods. Both history and \nacquaintance made me doubt that practitioners of the natural sciences \npossess firmer or more permanent answers to such questions than their \ncolleagues in social science. Yet, somehow, the practice of astronomy, \nphysics, chemistry, or biology normally fails to evoke the controversies \nover fundamentals that today often seem endemic among, say, \npsychologists or sociologists. Attempting to discover the source of that \ndifference led me to recognize the role in scientific research of what I \nhave since called \u201cparadigms.\u201d These I take to be universally recognized \nscientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and \nsolutions to a community of practitioners. Once that piece of my puzzle \nfell into place, a draft of this essay emerged rapidly. \n\nThe subsequent history of that draft need not be recounted here, but \na few words must be said about the form that it has preserved through \nrevisions. Until a first version had been completed and largely revised, I \nanticipated that the manuscript would appear exclusively as a volume in \nthe Encyclopedia of Unified Science. The editors of that pioneering work \nhad first solicited it, then held me firmly to a commitment, and finally \nwaited with extraordinary tact and patience for a result. I am much \nindebted to them, particularly to Charles Morris, for wielding the \nessential goad and for advising me about the manuscript that resulted. \nSpace limits of the Encyclopedia made it necessary, however, to present \nmy views in an extremely condensed and schematic form. Though \nsubsequent events have somewhat relaxed those restrictions and have \nmade possible simultaneous independent publication, this work remains \nan essay rather than the full-scale book my subject will ultimately \ndemand. \n\nSince my most fundamental objective is to urge a change in  \n \n\nVol. II, No. 2 \nviii \n\n\n\nPreface \n \nthe perception and evaluation of familiar data, the schematic character \nof this first presentation need be no drawback. On the contrary, readers \nwhose own research has prepared them for the sort of reorientation \nhere advocated may find the essay form both more suggestive and easier \nto assimilate. But it has disadvantages as well, and these may justify my \nillustrating at the very start the sorts of extension in both scope and \ndepth that I hope ultimately to include in a longer version. Far more \nhistorical evidence is available than I have had space to exploit below. \nFurthermore, that evidence comes from the history of biological as well \nas of physical science. My decision to deal here exclusively with the \nlatter was made partly to increase this essay\u2019s coherence and partly on \ngrounds of present competence. In addition, the view of science to be \ndeveloped here suggests the potential fruitfulness of a number of new \nsorts of research, both historical and sociological. For example, the \nmanner in which anomalies, or violations of expectation, attract the \nincreasing attention of a scientific community needs detailed study, as \ndoes the emergence of the crises that may be induced by repeated \nfailure to make an anomaly conform. Or again, if I am right that each \nscientific revolution alters the historical perspective of the community \nthat experiences it, then that change of perspective should affect the \nstructure of postrevolutionary textbooks and research publications. One \nsuch effect\u2014a shift in the distribution of the technical literature cited in \nthe footnotes to research reports\u2014ought to be studied as a possible \nindex to the occurrence of revolutions. \n\nThe need for drastic condensation has also forced me to forego \ndiscussion of a number of major problems. My distinction between the \npre- and the post-paradigm periods in the development of a science is, \nfor example, much too schematic. Each of the schools whose \ncompetition characterizes the earlier period is guided by something \nmuch like a paradigm; there are circumstances, though I think them \nrare, under which two paradigms can coexist peacefully in the later \nperiod. Mere possession of a paradigm is not quite a sufficient criterion \nfor the developmental transition discussed in Section II. More \nimportant, ex- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \nix \n\n\n\nPreface \n \n\ncept in occasional brief asides, I have said nothing about the role of \ntechnological advance or of external social, economic, and intellectual \nconditions in the development of the sciences. One need, however, look \nno further than Copernicus and the calendar to discover that external \nconditions may help to transform a mere anomaly into a source of acute \ncrisis. The same example would illustrate the way in which conditions \noutside the sciences may influence the range of alternatives available to \nthe man who seeks to end a crisis by proposing one or another \nrevolutionary reform.4 Explicit consideration of effects like these would \nnot, I think, modify the main theses developed in this essay, but it would \nsurely add an analytic dimension of first-rate importance for the \nunderstanding of scientific advance. \n\nFinally, and perhaps most important of all, limitations of space have \ndrastically affected my treatment of the philosophical implications of \nthis essay\u2019s historically oriented view of science. Clearly, there are such \nimplications, and I have tried both to point out and to document the \nmain ones. But in doing so I have usually refrained from detailed \ndiscussion of the various positions taken by contemporary philosophers \non the corresponding issues. Where I have indicated skepticism, it has \nmore often been directed to a philosophical attitude than to any one of \nits fully articulated expressions. As a result, some of those who know \nand work within one of those articulated positions may feel that I have \nmissed their point. I think they will be wrong, but this essay is not \ncalculated to convince them. To attempt that would have required a far \nlonger and very different sort of book. \n\nThe  autobiographical fragments  with  which  this  preface \n \n4 These factors are discussed in T. S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution: Planetary \nAstronomy in the Development of Western Thought (Cambridge, Mass., 1957), pp. \n122-32, 270-71. Other effects of external intellectual and economic conditions \nupon substantive scientific development are illustrated in my papers, \n\u201cConservation of Energy as an Example of Simultaneous Discovery,\u201d Critical \nProblems in the History of Science, ed. Marshall Clagett (Madison, Wis., 1959), pp. \n321-56; \u201cEngineering Precedent for the Work of Sadi Carnot,\u201d Archives \ninternationales d\u2019histoire des sciences, XIII (1960), 247-51; and \u201cSadi Carnot and the \nCagnard Engine,\u201d Isis, LII (1961), 567-74. It is, therefore, only with respect to the \nproblems discussed in this essay that I take the role of external factors to be \nminor. \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \nx \n\n\n\nPreface \n \n\nopens will serve to acknowledge what I can recognize of my main debt \nboth to the works of scholarship and to the institutions that have helped \ngive form to my thought. The remainder of that debt I shall try to \ndischarge by citation in the pages that follow. Nothing said above or \nbelow, however, will more than hint at the number and nature of my \npersonal obligations to the many individuals whose suggestions and \ncriticisms have at one time or another sustained and directed my \nintellectual development. Too much time has elapsed since the ideas in \nthis essay began to take shape; a list of all those who may properly find \nsome signs of their influence in its pages would be almost coextensive \nwith a list of my friends and acquaintances. Under the circumstances, I \nmust restrict myself to the few most significant influences that even a \nfaulty memory will never entirely suppress. \n\nIt was James B. Conant, then president of Harvard University, who \nfirst introduced me to the history of science and thus initiated the \ntransformation in my conception of the nature of scientific advance. \nEver since that process began, he has been generous of his ideas, \ncriticisms, and time\u2014including the time required to read and suggest \nimportant changes in the draft of my manuscript. Leonard K. Nash, with \nwhom for five years I taught the historically oriented course that Dr. \nConant had started, was an even more active collaborator during the \nyears when my ideas first began to take shape, and he has been much \nmissed during the later stages of their development. Fortunately, \nhowever, after my departure from Cambridge, his place as creative \nsounding board and more was assumed by my Berkeley colleague, \nStanley Cavell. That Cavell, a philosopher mainly concerned with ethics \nand aesthetics, should have reached conclusions quite so congruent to \nmy own has been a constant source of stimulation and encouragement \nto me. He is, furthermore, the only person with whom I have ever been \nable to explore my ideas in incomplete sentences. That mode of \ncommunication attests an understanding that has enabled him to point \nme the way through or around several major barriers encountered while \npreparing my first manuscript. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \nxi \n\n\n\nPreface \n \nSince that version was drafted, many other friends have helped with \n\nits reformulation. They will, I think, forgive me if I name only the four \nwhose contributions proved most far-reaching and decisive: Paul K. \nFeyerabend of Berkeley, Ernest Nagel of Columbia, H. Pierre Noyes of \nthe Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, and my student, John L. Heilbron, \nwho has often worked closely with me in preparing a final version for \nthe press. I have found all their reservations and suggestions extremely \nhelpful, but I have no reason to believe (and some reason to doubt) that \neither they or the others mentioned above approve in its entirety the \nmanuscript that results. \n\nMy final acknowledgments, to my parents, wife, and children, must \nbe of a rather different sort. In ways which I shall probably be the last to \nrecognize, each of them, too, has contributed intellectual ingredients to \nmy work. But they have also, in varying degrees, done something more \nimportant. They have, that is, let it go on and even encouraged my \ndevotion to it. Anyone who has wrestled with a project like mine will \nrecognize what it has occasionally cost them. I do not know how to give \nthem thanks. \n\n      T. S.

Introduction: A Role for History \n\n \nHistory, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or \n\nchronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of \nscience by which we are now possessed. That image has previously been \ndrawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of finished \nscientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics and, more \nrecently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific generation \nlearns to practice its trade. Inevitably, however, the aim of such books is \npersuasive and pedagogic; a concept of science drawn from them is no \nmore likely to fit the enterprise that produced them than an image of a \nnational culture drawn from a tourist brochure or a language text. This \nessay attempts to show that we have been misled by them in \nfundamental ways. Its aim is a sketch of the quite different concept of \nscience that can emerge from the historical record of the research \nactivity itself. \n\nEven from history, however, that new concept will not be forthcoming \nif historical data continue to be sought and scrutinized mainly to answer \nquestions posed by the unhistorical stereotype drawn from science texts. \nThose texts have, for example, often seemed to imply that the content of \nscience is uniquely exemplified by the observations, laws, and theories \ndescribed in their pages. Almost as regularly, the same books have been \nread as saying that scientific methods are simply the ones illustrated by \nthe manipulative techniques used in gathering textbook data, together \nwith the logical operations employed when relating those data to the \ntextbook\u2019s theoretical generalizations. The result has been a concept of \nscience with profound implications about its nature and development. \n\nIf science is the constellation of facts, theories, and methods collected \nin current texts, then scientists are the men who, successfully or not, \nhave striven to contribute one or another element to that particular \nconstellation. Scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by \nwhich these items have been \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n1 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nadded, singly and in combination, to the ever growing stockpile that \nconstitutes scientific technique and knowledge. And history of science \nbecomes the discipline that chronicles both these successive increments \nand the obstacles that have inhibited their accumulation. Concerned \nwith scientific development, the historian then appears to have two \nmain tasks. On the one hand, he must determine by what man and at \nwhat point in time each contemporary scientific fact, law, and theory \nwas discovered or invented. On the other, he must describe and explain \nthe congeries of error, myth and superstition that have inhibited the \nmore rapid accumulation of the constituents of the modern science text. \nMuch research has been directed to these ends, and some still is. \n\nIn recent years, however, a few historians of science have been finding \nit more and more difficult to fulfil the functions that the concept of \ndevelopment-by-accumulation assigns to them. As chroniclers of an \nincremental process, they discover that additional research makes it \nharder, not easier, to answer questions like: When was oxygen \ndiscovered? Who first conceived of energy conservation? Increasingly, a \nfew of them suspect that these are simply the wrong sorts of questions \nto ask. Perhaps science does not develop by the accumulation of \nindividual discoveries and inventions. Simultaneously, these same \nhistorians confront growing difficulties in distinguishing the \u201cscientific\u201d \ncomponent of past observation and belief from what their predecessors \nhad readily labeled \u201cerror\u201d and \u201csuperstition.\u201d The more carefully they \nstudy, say, Aristotelian dynamics, phlogistic chemistry, or caloric \nthermodynamics, the more certain they feel that those once current \nviews of nature were, as a whole, neither less scientific nor more the \nproduct of human idiosyncrasy than those current today. If these out-of-\ndate beliefs are to be called myths, then myths can be produced by the \nsame sorts of methods and held for the same sorts of reasons that now \nlead to scientific knowledge. If, on the other hand, they are to be called \nscience, then science has included bodies of belief quite incompatible \nwith the ones we hold today. Given these alternatives, the historian must \nchoose the latter. Out-of- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n2 \n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Role for History \n \n\ndate theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been \ndiscarded. That choice, however, makes it difficult to see scientific \ndevelopment as a process of accretion. The same historical research that \ndisplays the difficulties in isolating individual inventions and discoveries \ngives ground for profound doubts about the cumulative process through \nwhich these individual contributions to science were thought to have \nbeen compounded. \n\nThe result of all these doubts and difficulties is a historiographic \nrevolution in the study of science, though one that is still in its early \nstages. Gradually, and often without entirely realizing they are doing so, \nhistorians of science have begun to ask new sorts of questions and to \ntrace different, and often less than cumulative, developmental lines for \nthe sciences. Rather than seeking the permanent contributions of an \nolder science to our present vantage, they attempt to display the \nhistorical integrity of that science in its own time. They ask, for example, \nnot about the relation of Galileo\u2019s views to those of modern science, but \nrather about the relationship between his views and those of his group, \ni.e., his teachers, contemporaries, and immediate successors in the \nsciences. Furthermore, they insist upon studying the opinions of that \ngroup and other similar ones from the viewpoint\u2014usually very different \nfrom that of modern science\u2014that gives those opinions the maximum \ninternal coherence and the closest possible fit to nature. Seen through \nthe works that result, works perhaps best exemplified in the writings of \nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, science does not seem altogether the same enterprise \nas the one discussed by writers in the older historiographic tradition. By \nimplication, at least, these historical studies suggest the possibility of a \nnew image of science. This essay aims to delineate that image by making \nexplicit some of the new historiography\u2019s implications. \n\nWhat aspects of science will emerge to prominence in the course of \nthis effort? First, at least in order of presentation, is the insufficiency of \nmethodological directives, by themselves, to dictate a unique \nsubstantive conclusion to many sorts of scientific questions. Instructed \nto examine electrical or chemical phe- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n3 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nnomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but who knows what it \nis to be scientific may legitimately reach any one of a number of \nincompatible conclusions. Among those legitimate possibilities, the \nparticular conclusions he does arrive at are probably determined by his \nprior experience in other fields, by the accidents of his investigation, and \nby his own individual makeup. What beliefs about the stars, for \nexample, does he bring to the study of chemistry or electricity? Which of \nthe many conceivable experiments relevant to the new field does he \nelect to perform first? And what aspects of the complex phenomenon \nthat then results strike him as particularly relevant to an elucidation of \nthe nature of chemical change or of electrical affinity? For the \nindividual, at least, and sometimes for the scientific community as well, \nanswers to questions like these are often essential determinants of \nscientific development. We shall note, for example, in Section II that the \nearly developmental stages of most sciences have been characterized by \ncontinual competition between a number of distinct views of nature, \neach partially derived from, and all roughly compatible with, the \ndictates of scientific observation and method. What differentiated these \nvarious schools was not one or another failure of method\u2014 they were all \n\u201cscientific\u201d\u2014but what we shall come to call their incommensurable ways \nof seeing the world and of practicing science in it. Observation and \nexperience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible \nscientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone \ndetermine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary \nelement, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a \nformative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific \ncommunity at a given time. \n\nThat element of arbitrariness does not, however, indicate that any \nscientific group could practice its trade without some set of received \nbeliefs. Nor does it make less consequential the particular constellation \nto which the group, at a given time, is in fact committed. Effective \nresearch scarcely begins before a scientific community thinks it has \nacquired firm answers to questions like the following: What are the \nfundamental entities  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n4 \n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Role for History \n \n\nof which the universe is composed? How do these interact with each \nother and with the senses? What questions may legitimately be asked \nabout such entities and what techniques employed in seeking solutions? \nAt least in the mature sciences, answers (or full substitutes for answers) \nto questions like these are firmly embedded in the educational initiation \nthat prepares and licenses the student for professional practice. Because \nthat education is both rigorous and rigid, these answers come to exert a \ndeep hold on the scientific mind. That they can do so does much to \naccount both for the peculiar efficiency of the normal research activity \nand for the direction in which it proceeds at any given time. When \nexamining normal science in Sections III, IV, and V, we shall want finally \nto describe that research as a strenuous and devoted attempt to force \nnature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education. \nSimultaneously, we shall wonder whether research could proceed \nwithout such boxes, whatever the element of arbitrariness in their \nhistoric origins and, occasionally, in their subsequent development. \n\nYet that element of arbitrariness is present, and it too has an \nimportant effect on scientific development, one which will be examined \nin detail in Sections VI, VII, and VIII. Normal science, the activity in \nwhich most scientists inevitably spend almost all their time, is \npredicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what \nthe world is like. Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the \ncommunity\u2019s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at \nconsiderable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses \nfundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its \nbasic commitments. Nevertheless, so long as those commitments retain \nan element of the arbitrary, the very nature of normal research ensures \nthat novelty shall not be suppressed for very long. Sometimes a normal \nproblem, one that ought to be solvable by known rules and procedures, \nresists the reiterated onslaught of the ablest members of the group \nwithin whose competence it falls. On other occasions a piece of \nequipment designed and constructed for the purpose of normal \nresearch fails \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n5 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nto perform in the anticipated manner, revealing an anomaly that cannot, \ndespite repeated effort, be aligned with professional expectation. In \nthese and other ways besides, normal science repeatedly goes astray. \nAnd when it does\u2014when, that is, the profession can no longer evade \nanomalies that subvert the existing tradition of scientific practice\u2014then \nbegin the extraordinary investigations that lead the profession at last to \na new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of science. The \nextraordinary episodes in which that shift of professional commitments \noccurs are the ones known in this essay as scientific revolutions. They \nare the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity \nof normal science. \n\nThe most obvious examples of scientific revolutions are those famous \nepisodes in scientific development that have often been labeled \nrevolutions before. Therefore, in Sections IX and X, where the nature of \nscientific revolutions is first directly scrutinized, we shall deal repeatedly \nwith the major turning points in scientific development associated with \nthe names of Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier, and Einstein. More clearly \nthan most other episodes in the history of at least the physical sciences, \nthese display what all scientific revolutions are about. Each of them \nnecessitated the community\u2019s rejection of one time-honored scientific \ntheory in favor of another incompatible with it. Each produced a \nconsequent shift in the problems available for scientific scrutiny and in \nthe standards by which the profession determined what should count as \nan admissible problem or as a legitimate problem-solution. And each \ntransformed the scientific imagination in ways that we shall ultimately \nneed to describe as a transformation of the world within which scientific \nwork was done. Such changes, together with the controversies that \nalmost always accompany them, are the defining characteristics of \nscientific revolutions. \n\nThese characteristics emerge with particular clarity from a study of, \nsay, the Newtonian or the chemical revolution. It is, however, a \nfundamental thesis of this essay that they can also be retrieved from the \nstudy of many other episodes that were not so obviously revolutionary. \nFor the far smaller professional  \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n6 \n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Role for History \n \n\ngroup affected by them, Maxwell\u2019s equations were as revolutionary as \nEinstein\u2019s, and they were resisted accordingly. The invention of other \nnew theories regularly, and appropriately, evokes the same response \nfrom some of the specialists on whose area of special competence they \nimpinge. For these men the new theory implies a change in the rules \ngoverning the prior practice of normal science. Inevitably, therefore, it \nreflects upon much scientific work they have already successfully \ncompleted. That is why a new theory, however special its range of \napplication, is seldom or never just an increment to what is already \nknown. Its assimilation requires the reconstruction of prior theory and \nthe re-evaluation of prior fact, an intrinsically revolutionary process that \nis seldom completed by a single man and never overnight. No wonder \nhistorians have had difficulty in dating precisely this extended process \nthat their vocabulary impels them to view as an isolated event. \n\nNor are new inventions of theory the only scientific events that have \nrevolutionary impact upon the specialists in whose domain they occur. \nThe commitments that govern normal science specify not only what \nsorts of entities the universe does contain, but also, by implication, those \nthat it does not. It follows, though the point will require extended \ndiscussion, that a discovery like that of oxygen or X-rays does not simply \nadd one more item to the population of the scientist\u2019s world. Ultimately \nit has that effect, but not until the professional community has re-\nevaluated traditional experimental procedures, altered its conception of \nentities with which it has long been familiar, and, in the process, shifted \nthe network of theory through which it deals with the world. Scientific \nfact and theory are not categorically separable, except perhaps within a \nsingle tradition of normal-scientific practice. That is why the unexpected \ndiscovery is not simply factual in its import and why the scientist\u2019s world \nis qualitatively transformed as well as quantitatively enriched by \nfundamental novelties of either fact or theory. \n\nThis extended conception of the nature of scientific revolutions is the \none delineated in the pages that follow. Admittedly the extension strains \ncustomary usage. Nevertheless, I shall con- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n7 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ntinue to speak even of discoveries as revolutionary, because it is just the \npossibility of relating their structure to that of, say, the Copernican \nrevolution that makes the extended conception seem to me so \nimportant. The preceding discussion indicates how the complementary \nnotions of normal science and of scientific revolutions will be developed \nin the nine sections immediately to follow. The rest of the essay attempts \nto dispose of three remaining central questions. Section XI, by \ndiscussing the textbook tradition, considers why scientific revolutions \nhave previously been so difficult to see. Section XII describes the \nrevolutionary competition between the proponents of the old normal-\nscientific tradition and the adherents of the new one. It thus considers \nthe process that should somehow, in a theory of scientific inquiry, \nreplace the confirmation or falsification procedures made familiar by \nour usual image of science. Competition between segments of the \nscientific community is the only historical process that ever actually \nresults in the rejection of one previously accepted theory or in the \nadoption of another. Finally, Section XIII will ask how development \nthrough revolutions can be compatible with the apparently unique \ncharacter of scientific progress. For that question, however, this essay \nwill provide no more than the main outlines of an answer, one which \ndepends upon characteristics of the scientific community that require \nmuch additional exploration and study. \n\nUndoubtedly, some readers will already have wondered whether \nhistorical study can possibly effect the sort of conceptual transformation \naimed at here. An entire arsenal of dichotomies is available to suggest \nthat it cannot properly do so. History, we too often say, is a purely \ndescriptive discipline. The theses suggested above are, however, often \ninterpretive and sometimes normative. Again, many of my \ngeneralizations are about the sociology or social psychology of scientists; \nyet at least a few of my conclusions belong traditionally to logic or \nepistemology. In the preceding paragraph I may even seem to have \nviolated the very influential contemporary distinction between \u201cthe \ncontext of discovery\u201d and \u201cthe context of justifica- \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n8 \n\n\n\nIntroduction: A Role for History \n \n\ntion.\u201d Can anything more than profound confusion be indicated by this \nadmixture of diverse fields and concerns? \n\nHaving been weaned intellectually on these distinctions and others \nlike them, I could scarcely be more aware of their import and force. For \nmany years I took them to be about the nature of knowledge, and I still \nsuppose that, appropriately recast, they have something important to \ntell us. Yet my attempts to apply them, even grosso modo, to the actual \nsituations in which knowledge is gained, accepted, and assimilated have \nmade them seem extraordinarily problematic. Rather than being \nelementary logical or methodological distinctions, which would thus be \nprior to the analysis of scientific knowledge, they now seem integral \nparts of a traditional set of substantive answers to the very questions \nupon which they have been deployed. That circularity does not at all \ninvalidate them. But it does make them parts of a theory and, by doing \nso, subjects them to the same scrutiny regularly applied to theories in \nother fields. If they are to have more than pure abstraction as their \ncontent, then that content must be discovered by observing them in \napplication to the data they are meant to elucidate. How could history \nof science fail to be a source of phenomena to which theories about \nknowledge may legitimately be asked to apply? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n9 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII. The Route to Normal Science \n\n \nIn this essay, \u2018normal science\u2019 means research firmly based upon one \n\nor more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular \nscientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the \nfoundation for its further practice. Today such achievements are \nrecounted, though seldom in their original form, by science textbooks, \nelementary and advanced. These textbooks expound the body of \naccepted theory, illustrate many or all of its successful applications, and \ncompare these applications with exemplary observations and \nexperiments. Before such books became popular early in the nineteenth \ncentury (and until even more recently in the newly matured sciences), \nmany of the famous classics of science fulfilled a similar function. \nAristotle\u2019s Physica, Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest, Newton\u2019s Principia and Opticks, \nFranklin\u2019s Electricity, Lavoisier\u2019s Chemistry, and Lyell\u2019s Geology\u2014these and \nmany other works served for a time implicitly to define the legitimate \nproblems and methods of a research field for succeeding generations of \npractitioners. They were able to do so because they shared two essential \ncharacteristics. Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to \nattract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of \nscientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave \nall sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve. \n\nAchievements that share these two characteristics I shall henceforth \nrefer to as \u2018paradigms,\u2019 a term that relates closely to \u2018normal science.\u2019 By \nchoosing it, I mean to suggest that some accepted examples of actual \nscientific practice\u2014examples which include law, theory, application, and \ninstrumentation together\u2014 provide models from which spring particular \ncoherent traditions of scientific research. These are the traditions which \nthe historian describes under such rubrics as \u2018Ptolemaic astronomy\u2019 (or \n\u2018Copernican\u2019), \u2018Aristotelian dynamics\u2019 (or \u2018Newtonian\u2019), \u2018corpuscular \noptics\u2019 (or \u2018wave optics\u2019), and so on. The study of  \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n10 \n\n\n\nThe Route to Normal Science \n \n\nparadigms, including many that are far more specialized than those \nnamed illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for \nmembership in the particular scientific community with which he will \nlater practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their \nfield from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will \nseldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals. Men whose \nresearch is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules \nand standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the \napparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science, \ni.e., for the genesis and continuation of a particular research tradition. \n\nBecause in this essay the concept of a paradigm will often substitute \nfor a variety of familiar notions, more will need to be said about the \nreasons for its introduction. Why is the concrete scientific achievement, \nas a locus of professional commitment, prior to the various concepts, \nlaws, theories, and points of view that may be abstracted from it? In \nwhat sense is the shared paradigm a fundamental unit for the student of \nscientific development, a unit that cannot be fully reduced to logically \natomic components which might function in its stead? When we \nencounter them in Section V, answers to these questions and to others \nlike them will prove basic to an understanding both of normal science \nand of the associated concept of paradigms. That more abstract \ndiscussion will depend, however, upon a previous exposure to examples \nof normal science or of paradigms in operation. In particular, both these \nrelated concepts will be clarified by noting that there can be a sort of \nscientific research without paradigms, or at least without any so \nunequivocal and so binding as the ones named above. Acquisition of a \nparadigm and of the more esoteric type of research it permits is a sign of \nmaturity in the development of any given scientific field. \n\nIf the historian traces the scientific knowledge of any selected group \nof related phenomena backward in time, he is likely to encounter some \nminor variant of a pattern here illustrated from the history of physical \noptics. Today\u2019s physics textbooks tell the \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n11 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nstudent that light is photons, i.e., quantum-mechanical entities that \nexhibit some characteristics of waves and some of particles. Research \nproceeds accordingly, or rather according to the more elaborate and \nmathematical characterization from which this usual verbalization is \nderived. That characterization of light is, however, scarcely half a \ncentury old. Before it was developed by Planck, Einstein, and others \nearly in this century, physics texts taught that light was transverse wave \nmotion, a conception rooted in a paradigm that derived ultimately from \nthe optical writings of Young and Fresnel in the early nineteenth \ncentury. Nor was the wave theory the first to be embraced by almost all \npractitioners of optical science. During the eighteenth century the \nparadigm for this field was provided by Newton\u2019s Opticks, which taught \nthat light was material corpuscles. At that time physicists sought \nevidence, as the early wave theorists had not, of the pressure exerted by \nlight particles impinging on solid bodies.1 \n\nThese transformations of the paradigms of physical optics are \nscientific revolutions, and the successive transition from one paradigm \nto another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature \nscience. It is not, however, the pattern characteristic of the period before \nNewton\u2019s work, and that is the contrast that concerns us here. No period \nbetween remote antiquity and the end of the seventeenth century \nexhibited a single generally accepted view about the nature of light. \nInstead there were a number of competing schools and sub-schools, \nmost of them espousing one variant or another of Epicurean, \nAristotelian, or Platonic theory. One group took light to be particles \nemanating from material bodies; for another it was a modification of the \nmedium that intervened between tie body and the eye; still another \nexplained light in terms of an interaction of the medium with an \nemanation from the eye; and there were other combinations and \nmodifications besides. Each of the corresponding schools derived \nstrength from its relation to some particular metaphysic, and each \nemphasized, as para- \n \n\n1 Joseph Priestley, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light, and \nColours (London, 1772), pp. 385-90. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n12 \n\n\n\nThe Route to Normal Science \n \n\ndigmatic observations, the particular cluster of optical phenomena that \nits own theory could do most to explain. Other observations were dealt \nwith by ad hoc elaborations, or they remained as outstanding problems \nfor further research.2 \n\nAt various times all these schools made significant contributions to \nthe body of concepts, phenomena, and techniques from which Newton \ndrew the first nearly uniformly accepted paradigm for physical optics. \nAny definition of the scientist that excludes at least the more creative \nmembers of these various schools will exclude their modern successors \nas well. Those men were scientists. Yet anyone examining a survey of \nphysical optics before Newton may well conclude that, though the field\u2019s \npractitioners were scientists, the net result of their activity was \nsomething less than science. Being able to take no common body of \nbelief for granted, each writer on physical optics felt forced to build his \nfield anew from its foundations. In doing so, his choice of supporting \nobservation and experiment was relatively free, for there was no \nstandard set of methods or of phenomena that every optical writer felt \nforced to employ and explain. Under these circumstances, the dialogue \nof the resulting books was often directed as much to the members of \nother schools as it was to nature. That pattern is not unfamiliar in a \nnumber of creative fields today, nor is it incompatible with significant \ndiscovery and invention. It is not, however, the pattern of development \nthat physical optics acquired after Newton and that other natural \nsciences make familiar today. \n\nThe history of electrical research in the first half of the eighteenth \ncentury provides a more concrete and better known example of the way \na science develops before it acquires its first universally received \nparadigm. During that period there were almost as many views about \nthe nature of electricity as there were important electrical \nexperimenters, men like Hauksbee, Gray, Desaguliers, Du Fay, Nollett, \nWatson, Franklin, and others. All their numerous concepts of electricity \nhad something in common\u2014they were partially derived from one or an- \n\n \n2 Vasco Ronchi, Histoire de la lumi\u00e8re, trans. Jean Taton (Paris, 1956), chaps. i-iv. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n13 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \nother version of the mechanico-corpuscular philosophy that guided all \nscientific research of the day. In addition, all were components of real \nscientific theories, of theories that had been drawn in part from \nexperiment and observation and that partially determined the choice \nand interpretation of additional problems undertaken in research. Yet \nthough all the experiments were electrical and though most of the \nexperimenters read each other\u2019s works, their theories had no more than \na family resemblance.3 \n\nOne early group of theories, following seventeenth-century practice, \nregarded attraction and factional generation as the fundamental \nelectrical phenomena. This group tended to treat repulsion as a \nsecondary effect due to some sort of mechanical rebounding and also to \npostpone for as long as possible both discussion and systematic research \non Gray\u2019s newly discovered effect, electrical conduction. Other \n\u201celectricians\u201d (the term is their own) took attraction and repulsion to be \nequally elementary manifestations of electricity and modified their \ntheories and research accordingly. (Actually, this group is remarkably \nsmall\u2014even Franklin\u2019s theory never quite accounted for the mutual \nrepulsion of two negatively charged bodies.) But they had as much \ndifficulty as the first group in accounting simultaneously for any but the \nsimplest conduction effects. Those effects, however, provided the \nstarting point for still a third group, one which tended to speak of \nelectricity as a \u201cfluid\u201d that could run through conductors rather than as \nan \u201ceffluvium\u201d that emanated from non-conductors. This group, in its \nturn, had difficulty reconciling its theory with a number of attractive \nand \n\n \n\n3 Duane Roller and Duane H. D.

Only through the work of Franklin and his immediate \nsuccessors did a theory arise that could account with something like \nequal facility for very nearly all these effects and that therefore could \nand did provide a subsequent generation of \u201celectricians\u201d with a \ncommon paradigm for its research. \n\nExcluding those fields, like mathematics and astronomy, in which the \nfirst firm paradigms date from prehistory and also those, like \nbiochemistry, that arose by division and recombination of specialties \nalready matured, the situations outlined above are historically typical. \nThough it involves my continuing to employ the unfortunate \nsimplification that tags an extended historical episode with a single and \nsomewhat arbitrarily chosen name (e.g., Newton or Franklin), I suggest \nthat similar fundamental disagreements characterized, for example, the \nstudy of motion before Aristotle and of statics before Archimedes, the \nstudy of heat before Black, of chemistry before Boyle and Boerhaave, \nand of historical geology before Hutton. In parts of biology\u2014the study of \nheredity, for example\u2014the first universally received paradigms are still \nmore recent; and it remains an open question what parts of social \nscience have yet acquired such paradigms at all. History suggests that \nthe road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous. \n\nHistory also suggests, however, some reasons for the difficulties \nencountered on that road. In the absence of a paradigm or some \ncandidate for paradigm, all of the facts that could possibly pertain to the \ndevelopment of a given science are likely to seem equally relevant. As a \nresult, early fact-gathering is a far more nearly random activity than the \none that subsequent scientific development makes familiar. \nFurthermore, in the absence of a reason for seeking some particular \nform of more recondite information, early fact-gathering is usually \nrestricted to the wealth of data that lie ready to hand. The resulting pool \nof facts contains those accessible to casual observation and experiment \ntogether with some of the more esoteric data retrievable from \nestablished crafts like medicine, calendar making, and metallurgy. \nBecause the crafts are one readily accessible source of facts that could \nnot have been casually discovered, technology \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n15 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nhas often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences. \nBut though this sort of fact-collecting has been essential to the origin \n\nof many significant sciences, anyone who examines, for example, Pliny\u2019s \nencyclopedic writings or the Baconian natural histories of the \nseventeenth century will discover that it produces a morass. One \nsomehow hesitates to call the literature that results scientific. The \nBaconian \u201chistories\u201d of heat, color, wind, mining, and so on, are filled \nwith information, some of it recondite. But they juxtapose facts that will \nlater prove revealing (e.g., heating by mixture) with others (e.g., the \nwarmth of dung heaps) that will for some time remain too complex to \nbe integrated with theory at all.4 In addition, since any description must \nbe partial, the typical natural history often omits from its immensely \ncircumstantial accounts just those details that later scientists will find \nsources of important illumination. Almost none of the early \u201chistories\u201d \nof electricity, for example, mention that chaff, attracted to a rubbed \nglass rod, bounces off again. That effect seemed mechanical, not \nelectrical.5 Moreover, since the casual fact-gatherer seldom possesses the \ntime or the tools to be critical, the natural histories often juxtapose \ndescriptions like the above with others, say, heating by antiperistasis (or \nby cooling), that we are now quite unable to confirm.8 Only very \noccasionally, as in the cases of ancient statics, dynamics, and geometrical \noptics, do facts collected with so little guidance from pre-established \ntheory speak with sufficient clarity to permit the emergence of a first \nparadigm. \n\nThis is the situation that creates the schools characteristic of the early \nstages of a science\u2019s development. No natural history can be interpreted \nin the absence of at least some implicit body \n\n \n\n4 Compare the sketch for a natural history of heat in Bacon\u2019s Novum Organum, Vol. VIII \nof The Works of Francis Bacon, ed.

Only after the work recorded in the last of \nthese citations do repulsive effects gain general recognition as unequivocally electrical. \n6 Bacon, op. cit., pp. 235, 337, says, \u201cWater slightly warm is more easily frozen than quite \ncold.\u201d For a partial account of the earlier history of this strange observation, see Marshall \nClagett, Giovanni Marliani and Late Medieval Physics (New York, 1941), chap. iv. \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n16 \n\n\n\nThe Route to Normal Science \n \n\nof intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits \nselection, evaluation, and criticism. If that body of belief is not already \nimplicit in the collection of facts\u2014in which case more than \u201cmere facts\u201d \nare at hand\u2014it must be externally supplied, perhaps by a current \nmetaphysic, by another science, or by personal and historical accident. \nNo wonder, then, that in the early stages of the development of any \nscience different men confronting the same range of phenomena, but \nnot usually all the same particular phenomena, describe and interpret \nthem in different ways. What is surprising, and perhaps also unique in \nits degree to the fields we call science, is that such initial divergences \nshould ever largely disappear. \n\nFor they do disappear to a very considerable extent and then \napparently once and for all. Furthermore, their disappearance is usually \ncaused by the triumph of one of the pre-paradigm schools, which, \nbecause of its own characteristic beliefs and preconceptions, emphasized \nonly some special part of the too sizable and inchoate pool of \ninformation. Those electricians who thought electricity a fluid and \ntherefore gave particular emphasis to conduction provide an excellent \ncase in point. Led by this belief, which could scarcely cope with the \nknown multiplicity of attractive and repulsive effects, several of them \nconceived the idea of bottling the electrical fluid. The immediate fruit of \ntheir efforts was the Leyden jar, a device which might never have been \ndiscovered by a man exploring nature casually or at random, but which \nwas in fact independently developed by at least two investigators in the \nearly 1740\u2019s.7 Almost from the start of his electrical researches, Franklin \nwas particularly concerned to explain that strange and, in the event, \nparticularly revealing piece of special apparatus. His success in doing so \nprovided the most effective of the arguments that made his theory a \nparadigm, though one that was still unable to account for quite all the \nknown cases of electrical repulsion.8 To be accepted as a paradigm, a \ntheory must seem better than its competitors, but \n\n \n\n7 Roller and Roller, op. cit., pp. 51-54. \n8 The troublesome case was the mutual repulsion of negatively charged bodies, for \nwhich see Cohen, op. cit., pp. 491-94, 531-43. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n17 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nit need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can \nbe confronted. \n\nWhat the fluid theory of electricity did for the subgroup that held it, \nthe Franklinian paradigm later did for the entire group of electricians. It \nsuggested which experiments would be worth performing and which, \nbecause directed to secondary or to overly complex manifestations of \nelectricity, would not. Only the paradigm did the job far more \neffectively, partly because the end of interschool debate ended the \nconstant reiteration of fundamentals and partly because the confidence \nthat they were on the right track encouraged scientists to undertake \nmore precise, esoteric, and consuming sorts of work.9 Freed from the \nconcern with any and all electrical phenomena, the united group of \nelectricians could pursue selected phenomena in far more detail, \ndesigning much special equipment for the task and employing it more \nstubbornly and systematically than electricians had ever done before. \nBoth fact collection and theory articulation became highly directed \nactivities. The effectiveness and efficiency of electrical research \nincreased accordingly, providing evidence for a societal version of \nFrancis Bacon\u2019s acute methodological dictum: \u201cTruth emerges more \nreadily from error than from confusion.\u201d10 \n\nWe shall be examining the nature of this highly directed or paradigm-\nbased research in the next section, but must first note briefly how the \nemergence of a paradigm affects the structure of the group that \npractices the field. When, in the development of a natural science, an \nindividual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the \nnext generation\u2019s practitioners, the older schools gradually disappear. In \npart their disappear- \n \n\n9 It should be noted that the acceptance of Franklin\u2019s theory did not end quite all debate. \nIn 1759 Robert Symmer proposed a two-fluid version of that theory, and for many years \nthereafter electricians were divided about whether electricity was a single fluid or two. \nBut the debates on this subject only confirm what has been said above about the manner \nin which a universally recognized achievement unites the profession. Electricians, \nthough they continued divided on this point, rapidly concluded that no experimental \ntests could distinguish the two versions of the theory and that they were therefore \nequivalent. After that, both schools could and did exploit all the benefits that the \nFranklinian theory provided (ibid., pp. 543-46,548-54). \n10 Bacon, op. cit., p. 210.  \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n18 \n\n\n\nThe Route to Normal Science \n \nance is caused by their members\u2019 conversion to the new paradigm. But \nthere are always some men who cling to one or another of the older \nviews, and they are simply read out of the profession, which thereafter \nignores their work. The new paradigm implies a new and more rigid \ndefinition of the field. Those unwilling or unable to accommodate their \nwork to it must proceed in isolation or attach themselves to some other \ngroup.11 Historically, they have often simply stayed in the departments \nof philosophy from which so many of the special sciences have been \nspawned. As these indications hint, it is sometimes just its reception of a \nparadigm that transforms a group previously interested merely in the \nstudy of nature into a profession or, at least, a discipline. In the sciences \n(though not in fields like medicine, technology, and law, of which the \nprincipal raison d\u2019\u00eatre is an external social need), the formation of \nspecialized journals, the foundation of specialists\u2019 societies, and the \nclaim for a special place in the curriculum have usually been associated \nwith a group\u2019s first reception of a single paradigm. At least this was the \ncase between the time, a century and a half ago, when the institutional \npattern of scientific specialization first developed and the very recent \ntime when the paraphernalia of specialization acquired a prestige of \ntheir own. \n\nThe more rigid definition of the scientific group has other \nconsequences. When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for \ngranted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field \nanew, starting from first principles and justify- \n \n\n11 The history of electricity provides an excellent example which could be duplicated \nfrom the careers of Priestley, Kelvin, and others. Franklin reports that Nollet, who at mid-\ncentury was the most influential of the Continental electricians, \u201clived to see himself the \nlast of his Sect, except Mr. B.\u2014his \u00c9l\u00e8ve and immediate Disciple\u201d (Max Farrand [ed.], \nBenjamin Franklin\u2019s Memoirs [Berkeley, Calif., 1949], pp. 384-86). More interesting, \nhowever, is the endurance of whole schools in increasing isolation from professional \nscience. Consider, for example, the case of astrology, which was once an integral part of \nastronomy. Or consider the continuation in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth \ncenturies of a previously respected tradition of \u201cromantic\u201d chemistry. This is the \ntradition discussed by Charles C. Gillispie in \u201cThe Encyclop\u00e9die and the Jacobin \nPhilosophy of Science: A Study in Ideas and Consequences,\u201d Critical Problems in the \nHistory of Science, ed.

That can be left to the writer of \ntextbooks. Given a textbook, however, the creative scientist can begin his \nresearch where it leaves off and thus concentrate exclusively upon the \nsubtlest and most esoteric aspects of the natural phenomena that \nconcern his group. And as he does this, his research communiqu\u00e9s will \nbegin to change in ways whose evolution has been too little studied but \nwhose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many. \nNo longer will his researches usually be embodied in books addressed, \nlike Franklin\u2019s Experiments . . . on Electricity or Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species, \nto anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. \nInstead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to \nprofessional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm \ncan be assumed and who prove to be the only ones able to read the \npapers addressed to them. \n\nToday in the sciences, books are usually either texts or retrospective \nreflections upon one aspect or another of the scientific life. The scientist \nwho writes one is more likely to find his professional reputation \nimpaired than enhanced. Only in the earlier, pre-paradigm, stages of the \ndevelopment of the various sciences did the book ordinarily possess the \nsame relation to professional achievement that it still retains in other \ncreative fields. And only in those fields that still retain the book, with or \nwithout the article, as a vehicle for research communication are the \nlines of professionalization still so loosely drawn that the layman may \nhope to follow progress by reading the practitioners\u2019 original reports. \nBoth in mathematics and astronomy, research reports had ceased \nalready in antiquity to be intelligible to a generally educated audience. \nIn dynamics, research became similarly esoteric in the later Middle \nAges, and it recaptured general intelligibility only briefly during the \nearly seventeenth century when a new paradigm replaced the one that \nhad guided medieval research. Electrical research began to require \ntranslation for the layman before the end of the eighteenth century, and \nmost other fields of physical science ceased to be generally accessible in \nthe nineteenth. During the same two cen- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n20 \n\n\n\nThe Route to Normal Science \n \nturies similar transitions can be isolated in the various parts of the \nbiological sciences. In parts of the social sciences they may well be \noccurring today. Although it has become customary, and is surely \nproper, to deplore the widening gulf that separates the professional \nscientist from his colleagues in other fields, too little attention is paid to \nthe essential relationship between that gulf and the mechanisms \nintrinsic to scientific advance. \n\nEver since prehistoric antiquity one field of study after another has \ncrossed the divide between what the historian might call its prehistory \nas a science and its history proper. These transitions to maturity have \nseldom been so sudden or so unequivocal as my necessarily schematic \ndiscussion may have implied. But neither have they been historically \ngradual, coextensive, that is to say, with the entire development of the \nfields within which they occurred. Writers on electricity during the first \nfour decades of the eighteenth century possessed far more information \nabout electrical phenomena than had their sixteenth-century \npredecessors. During the half-century after 1740, few new sorts of \nelectrical phenomena were added to their lists. Nevertheless, in \nimportant respects, the electrical writings of Cavendish, Coulomb, and \nVolta in the last third of the eighteenth century seem further removed \nfrom those of Gray, Du Fay, and even Franklin than are the writings of \nthese early eighteenth-century electrical discoverers from those of the \nsixteenth century.12 Sometime between 1740 and 1780, electricians were \nfor the first time enabled to take the foundations of their field for \ngranted. From that point they pushed on to more concrete and \nrecondite problems, and increasingly they then reported their results in \narticles addressed to other electricians rather than in books addressed to \nthe learned world at large. As a group they achieved what had been \ngained by astronomers in antiquity \n \n\n12 The post-Franklinian developments include an immense increase in the sensitivity of \ncharge detectors, the first reliable and generally diffused techniques for measuring \ncharge, the evolution of the concept of capacity and its relation to a newly refined notion \nof electric tension, and the quantification of electrostatic force.

The Nature of Normal Science \n\n \nWhat then is the nature of the more professional and esoteric \n\nresearch that a group\u2019s reception of a single paradigm permits? If the \nparadigm represents work that has been done once and for all, what \nfurther problems does it leave the united group to resolve? Those \nquestions will seem even more urgent if we now note one respect in \nwhich the terms used so far may be misleading. In its established usage, \na paradigm is an accepted model or pattern, and that aspect of its \nmeaning has enabled me, lacking a better word, to appropriate \n\u2018paradigm\u2019 here. But it will shortly be clear that the sense of \u2018model\u2019 and \n\u2018pattern\u2019 that permits the appropriation is not quite the one usual in \ndefining \u2018paradigm.\u2019 In grammar, for example, \u2018amo, amas, amat\u2019 is a \nparadigm because it displays the pattern to be used in conjugating a \nlarge number of other Latin verbs, e.g., in producing \u2018laudo, laudas, \nlaudat.\u2019 In this standard application, the paradigm functions by \npermitting the replication of examples any one of which could in \nprinciple serve to replace it. In a science, on the other hand, a paradigm \nis rarely an object for replication. Instead, like an accepted judicial \ndecision in the common law, it is an object for further articulation and \nspecification under new or more stringent conditions. \n\nTo see how this can be so, we must recognize how very limited in both \nscope and precision a paradigm can be at the time of its first \nappearance. Paradigms gain their status because they are more \nsuccessful than their competitors in solving a few problems that the \ngroup of practitioners has come to recognize as acute. To be more \nsuccessful is not, however, to be either completely successful with a \nsingle problem or notably successful with any large number. The success \nof a paradigm\u2014whether Aristotle\u2019s analysis of motion, Ptolemy\u2019s \ncomputations of planetary position, Lavoisier\u2019s application of the \nbalance, or Maxwell\u2019s mathematization of the electromagnetic field\u2014is \nat the start largely a promise of success discoverable in selected and \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n23 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nstill incomplete examples. Normal science consists in the actualization \nof that promise, an actualization achieved by extending the knowledge \nof those facts that the paradigm displays as particularly revealing, by \nincreasing the extent of the match between those facts and the \nparadigm\u2019s predictions, and by further articulation of the paradigm \nitself. \n\nFew people who are not actually practitioners of a mature science \nrealize how much mop-up work of this sort a paradigm leaves to be done \nor quite how fascinating such work can prove in the execution. And \nthese points need to be understood. Mop-ping-up operations are what \nengage most scientists throughout their careers. They constitute what I \nam here calling normal science. Closely examined, whether historically \nor in the contemporary laboratory, that enterprise seems an attempt to \nforce nature into the preformed and relatively inflexible box that the \nparadigm supplies. No part of the aim of normal science is to call forth \nnew sorts of phenomena; indeed those that will not fit the box are often \nnot seen at all. Nor do scientists normally aim to invent new theories, \nand they are often intolerant of those invented by others.1 Instead, \nnormal-scientific research is directed to the articulation of those \nphenomena and theories that the paradigm already supplies. \n\nPerhaps these are defects. The areas investigated by normal science \nare, of course, minuscule; the enterprise now under discussion has \ndrastically restricted vision. But those restrictions, born from confidence \nin a paradigm, turn out to be essential to the development of science. By \nfocusing attention upon a small range of relatively esoteric problems, \nthe paradigm forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a \ndetail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable. And normal \nscience possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of \nthe restrictions that bound research whenever the paradigm from which \nthey derive ceases to function effectively. At that point scientists begin \nto behave differently, and the nature of their research problems \nchanges. In the interim, however, during the \n \n\n1 Bernard Barber, \u201cResistance by Scientists to Scientific Discovery,\u201d Science, CXXXIV \n(1961), 596-602. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n24 \n\n\n\nThe Nature of Normal Science \n \nperiod when the paradigm is successful, the profession will have solved \nproblems that its members could scarcely have imagined and would \nnever have undertaken without commitment to the paradigm. And at \nleast part of that achievement always proves to be permanent. \n\nTo display more clearly what is meant by normal or paradigm-based \nresearch, let me now attempt to classify and illustrate the problems of \nwhich normal science principally consists. For convenience I postpone \ntheoretical activity and begin with fact-gathering, that is, with the \nexperiments and observations described in the technical journals \nthrough which scientists inform their professional colleagues of the \nresults of their continuing research. On what aspects of nature do \nscientists ordinarily report? What determines their choice? And, since \nmost scientific observation consumes much time, equipment, and \nmoney, what motivates the scientist to pursue that choice to a \nconclusion? \n\nThere are, I think, only three normal foci for factual scientific \ninvestigation, and they are neither always nor permanently distinct. \nFirst is that class of facts that the paradigm has shown to be particularly \nrevealing of the nature of things. By employing them in solving \nproblems, the paradigm has made them worth determining both with \nmore precision and in a larger variety of situations. At one time or \nanother, these significant factual determinations have included: in \nastronomy\u2014stellar position and magnitude, the periods of eclipsing \nbinaries and of planets; in physics\u2014the specific gravities and \ncompressibilities of materials, wave lengths and spectral intensities, \nelectrical conductivities and contact potentials; and in chemistry\u2014\ncomposition and combining weights, boiling points and acidity of \nsolutions, structural formulas and optical activities. Attempts to increase \nthe accuracy and scope with which facts like these are known occupy a \nsignificant fraction of the literature of experimental and observational \nscience. Again and again complex special apparatus has been designed \nfor such purposes, and the invention, construction, and deployment of \nthat apparatus have demanded first-rate talent, much time, and \nconsiderable financial \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n25 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nbacking. Synchrotrons and radiotelescopes are only the most recent \nexamples of the lengths to which research workers will go if a paradigm \nassures them that the facts they seek are important. From Tycho Brahe \nto E. O. Lawrence, some scientists have acquired great reputations, not \nfrom any novelty of their discoveries, but from the precision, reliability, \nand scope of the methods they developed for the redetermination of a \npreviously known sort of fact. \n\nA second usual but smaller class of factual determinations is directed \nto those facts that, though often without much intrinsic interest, can be \ncompared directly with predictions from the paradigm theory. As we \nshall see shortly, when I turn from the experimental to the theoretical \nproblems of normal science, there are seldom many areas in which a \nscientific theory, particularly if it is cast in a predominantly \nmathematical form, can be directly compared with nature. No more \nthan three such areas are even yet accessible to Einstein\u2019s general theory \nof relativity.2 Furthermore, even in those areas where application is \npossible, it often demands theoretical and instrumental approximations \nthat severely limit the agreement to be expected. Improving that \nagreement or finding new areas in which agreement can be \ndemonstrated at all presents a constant challenge to the skill and \nimagination of the experimentalist and observer. Special telescopes to \ndemonstrate the Copernican prediction of annual parallax; Atwood\u2019s \nmachine, first invented almost a century after the Principia, to give the \nfirst unequivocal demonstration of Newton\u2019s second law; Foucault\u2019s \napparatus to show that the speed of light is greater in air than in water; \nor the gigantic scintillation counter designed to demonstrate the \nexistence of \n \n\n2 The only long-standing check point still generally recognized is the precession of \nMercury\u2019s perihelion. The red shift in the spectrum of light from distant stars can be \nderived from considerations more elementary than general relativity, and the same may \nbe possible for the bending of light around the sun, a point now in some dispute. In any \ncase, measurements of the latter phenomenon remain equivocal. One additional check \npoint may have been established very recently: the gravitational shift of Mossbauer \nradiation. Perhaps there will soon be others in this now active but long dormant field. \nFor an up-to-date capsule account of the problem, see L. I. Schiff, \u201cA Report on the NASA \nConference on Experimental Tests of Theories of Relativity,\u201d Physics Today, XIV (1961), \n42-48. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n26 \n\n\n\nThe Nature of Normal Science \n \nthe neutrino\u2014these pieces of special apparatus and many others like \nthem illustrate the immense effort and ingenuity that have been \nrequired to bring nature and theory into closer and closer agreement.3 \nThat attempt to demonstrate agreement is a second type of normal \nexperimental work, and it is even more obviously dependent than the \nfirst upon a paradigm. The existence of the paradigm sets the problem \nto be solved; often the paradigm theory is implicated directly in the \ndesign of apparatus able to solve the problem. Without the Principia, for \nexample, measurements made with the Atwood machine would have \nmeant nothing at all. \n\nA third class of experiments and observations exhausts, I think, the \nfact-gathering activities of normal science. It consists of empirical work \nundertaken to articulate the paradigm theory, resolving some of its \nresidual ambiguities and permitting the solution of problems to which it \nhad previously only drawn attention. This class proves to be the most \nimportant of all, and its description demands its subdivision. In the \nmore mathematical sciences, some of the experiments aimed at \narticulation are directed to the determination of physical constants. \nNewton\u2019s work, for example, indicated that the force between two unit \nmasses at unit distance would be the same for all types of matter at all \npositions in the universe. But his own problems could be solved without \neven estimating the size of this attraction, the universal gravitational \nconstant; and no one else devised apparatus able to determine it for a \ncentury after the Principia appeared. Nor was Cavendish\u2019s famous \ndetermination in the 1790\u2019s the last. Because of its central position in \nphysical theory, improved values of the gravitational constant have been \nthe object of repeated efforts ever since by a number of outstanding \n \n\n3 For two of the parallax telescopes, see Abraham Wolf, A History of Science, Technology, \nand Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century (2d ed.; London, 1952), pp. 103-5.

Few of \nthese elaborate efforts would have been conceived and none would have \nbeen carried out without a paradigm theory to define the problem and \nto guarantee the existence of a stable solution. \n\nEfforts to articulate a paradigm are not, however, restricted to the \ndetermination of universal constants. They may, for example, also aim \nat quantitative laws: Boyle\u2019s Law relating gas pressure to volume, \nCoulomb\u2019s Law of electrical attraction, and Joule\u2019s formula relating heat \ngenerated to electrical resistance and current are all in this category. \nPerhaps it is not apparent that a paradigm is prerequisite to the \ndiscovery of laws like these. We often hear that they are found by \nexamining measurements undertaken for their own sake and without \ntheoretical commitment. But history offers no support for so excessively \nBaconian a method. Boyle\u2019s experiments were not conceivable (and if \nconceived would have received another interpretation or none at all) \nuntil air was recognized as an elastic fluid to which all the elaborate \nconcepts of hydrostatics could be applied.5 Coulomb\u2019s success depended \nupon his constructing special apparatus to measure the force between \npoint charges, (Those who had previously measured electrical forces \nusing ordinary pan balances, etc., had found no consistent or simple \nregularity at all.) But that design, in turn, depended upon the previous \nrecognition that every particle of electric fluid acts upon every other at a \ndistance. It was for the force between such particles\u2014the only force \nwhich might safely be assumed \n \n\n4 J. H.

In fact, so general and close is \nthe relation between qualitative paradigm and quantitative law that, \nsince Galileo, such laws have often been correctly guessed with the aid \nof a paradigm years before apparatus could be designed for their \nexperimental determination.7 \n\nFinally, there is a third sort of experiment which aims to articulate a \nparadigm. More than the others this one can resemble exploration, and \nit is particularly prevalent in those periods and sciences that deal more \nwith the qualitative than with the quantitative aspects of nature\u2019s \nregularity. Often a paradigm developed for one set of phenomena is \nambiguous in its application to other closely related ones. Then \nexperiments are necessary to choose among the alternative ways of \napplying the paradigm to the new area of interest. For example, the \nparadigm applications of the caloric theory were to heating and cooling \nby mixtures and by change of state. But heat could be released or \nabsorbed in many other ways\u2014e.g., by chemical combination, by \nfriction, and by compression or absorption of a gas\u2014and to each of these \nother phenomena the theory could be applied in several ways. If the \nvacuum had a heat capacity, for example, heating by compression could \nbe explained as the result of mixing gas with void. Or it might be due to \na change in the specific heat of gases with changing pressure. And there \nwere several other explanations besides. Many experiments were \nundertaken to elaborate these various possibilities and to distinguish \nbetween them; all these experiments arose from the caloric theory as \nparadigm, and all exploited it in the design of experiments and in the \ninterpretation of results.8 Once the phe- \n \n\n6 Duane Roller and Duane H.

Given \nthe phenomenon, how else could an experiment to elucidate it have \nbeen chosen? \n\nTurn now to the theoretical problems of normal science, which fall \ninto very nearly the same classes as the experimental and observational. \nA part of normal theoretical work, though only a small part, consists \nsimply in the use of existing theory to predict factual information of \nintrinsic value. The manufacture of astronomical ephemerides, the \ncomputation of lens characteristics, and the production of radio \npropagation curves are examples of problems of this sort. Scientists, \nhowever, generally regard them as hack work to be relegated to \nengineers or technicians. At no time do very many of them appear in \nsignificant scientific journals. But these journals do contain a great \nmany theoretical discussions of problems that, to the non-scientist, must \nseem almost identical. These are the manipulations of theory \nundertaken, not because the predictions in which they result are \nintrinsically valuable, but because they can be confronted directly with \nexperiment. Their purpose is to display a new application of the \nparadigm or to increase the precision of an application that has already \nbeen made. \n\nThe need for work of this sort arises from the immense difficulties \noften encountered in developing points of contact between a theory and \nnature. These difficulties can be briefly illustrated by an examination of \nthe history of dynamics after Newton. By the early eighteenth century \nthose scientists who found a paradigm in the Principia took the \ngenerality of its conclusions for granted, and they had every reason to \ndo so. No other work known to the history of science has simultaneously \npermitted so large an increase in both the scope and precision of \nresearch. For the heavens Newton had derived Kepler\u2019s Laws of \nplanetary motion and also explained certain of the observed respects in \nwhich the moon failed to obey them. For the earth he had derived the \nresults of some scattered observations on pendulums and the tides. With \nthe aid of additional but ad hoc assumptions, he had also been able to \nderive Boyle\u2019s Law  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n30 \n\n\n\nThe Nature of Normal Science \n \nand an important formula for the speed of sound in air. Given the state \nof science at the time, the success of the demonstrations was extremely \nimpressive. Yet given the presumptive generality of Newton\u2019s Laws, the \nnumber of these applications was not great, and Newton developed \nalmost no others. Furthermore, compared with what any graduate \nstudent of physics can achieve with those same laws today, Newton\u2019s few \napplications were not even developed with precision. Finally, the \nPrincipia had been designed for application chiefly to problems of \ncelestial mechanics. How to adapt it for terrestrial applications, \nparticularly for those of motion under constraint, was by no means \nclear. Terrestrial problems were, in any case, already being attacked with \ngreat success by a quite different set of techniques developed originally \nby Galileo and Huyghens and extended on the Continent during the \neighteenth century by the Bernoullis, d\u2019Alembert, and many others. \nPresumably their techniques and those of the Principia could be shown \nto be special cases of a more general formulation, but for some time no \none saw quite how.9 \n\nRestrict attention for the moment to the problem of precision. We \nhave already illustrated its empirical aspect. Special equipment\u2014like \nCavendish\u2019s apparatus, the Atwood machine, or improved telescopes\u2014\nwas required in order to provide the special data that the concrete \napplications of Newton\u2019s paradigm demanded. Similar difficulties in \nobtaining agreement existed on the side of theory. In applying his laws \nto pendulums, for example, Newton was forced to treat the bob as a \nmass point in order to provide a unique definition of pendulum length. \nMost of his theorems, the few exceptions being hypothetical and \npreliminary, also ignored the effect of air resistance. These were sound \nphysical approximations. Nevertheless, as approximations they \nrestricted the agreement to be expected \n \n\n9 C.

The same \ndifficulties appear even more clearly in the application of Newton\u2019s \ntheory to the heavens. Simple quantitative telescopic observations \nindicate that the planets do not quite obey Kepler\u2019s Laws, and Newton\u2019s \ntheory indicates that they should not. To derive those laws, Newton had \nbeen forced to neglect all gravitational attraction except that between \nindividual planets and the sun. Since the planets also attract each other, \nonly approximate agreement between the applied theory and telescopic \nobservation could be expected.10 \n\nThe agreement obtained was, of course, more than satisfactory to \nthose who obtained it. Excepting for some terrestrial problems, no other \ntheory could do nearly so well. None of those who questioned the \nvalidity of Newton\u2019s work did so because of its limited agreement with \nexperiment and observation. Nevertheless, these limitations of \nagreement left many fascinating theoretical problems for Newton\u2019s \nsuccessors. Theoretical techniques were, for example, required for \ntreating the motions of more than two simultaneously attracting bodies \nand for investigating the stability of perturbed orbits. Problems like \nthese occupied many of Europe\u2019s best mathematicians during the \neighteenth and early nineteenth century. Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and \nGauss all did some of their most brilliant work on problems aimed to \nimprove the match between Newton\u2019s paradigm and observation of the \nheavens. Many of these figures worked simultaneously to develop the \nmathematics required for applications that neither Newton nor the \ncontemporary Continental school of mechanics had even attempted. \nThey produced, for example, an immense literature and some very \npowerful mathematical techniques for hydrodynamics and for the \nproblem of vibrating strings. These problems of application account for \nwhat is probably the most brilliant and consuming scientific work of the \neighteenth century. Other examples could be discovered by an \nexamination of the post-paradigm period in the development of \nthermodynamics, the wave theory of light, electromagnetic the- \n \n10 Wolf,  op.  cit., pp. 75-81, 96-101; and William Whewell, History of the Inductive Sciences \n(rev. ed.; London, 1847), II, 213-71. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n32 \n\n\n\nThe Nature of Normal Science \n \nory, or any other branch of science whose fundamental laws are fully \nquantitative. At least in the more mathematical sciences, most \ntheoretical work is of this sort. \n\nBut it is not all of this sort. Even in the mathematical sciences there \nare also theoretical problems of paradigm articulation; and during \nperiods when scientific development is predominantly qualitative, these \nproblems dominate. Some of the problems, in both the more \nquantitative and more qualitative sciences, aim simply at clarification by \nreformulation. The Principia, for example, did not always prove an easy \nwork to apply, partly because it retained some of the clumsiness \ninevitable in a first venture and partly because so much of its meaning \nwas only implicit in its applications. For many terrestrial applications, in \nany case, an apparently unrelated set of Continental techniques seemed \nvastly more powerful. Therefore, from Euler and Lagrange in the \neighteenth century to Hamilton, Jacobi, and Hertz in the nineteenth, \nmany of Europe\u2019s most brilliant mathematical physicists repeatedly \nendeavored to reformulate mechanical theory in an equivalent but \nlogically and aesthetically more satisfying form. They wished, that is, to \nexhibit the explicit and implicit lessons of the Principia and of \nContinental mechanics in a logically more coherent version, one that \nwould be at once more uniform and less equivocal in its application to \nthe newly elaborated problems of mechanics.11 \n\nSimilar reformulations of a paradigm have occurred repeatedly in all \nof the sciences, but most of them have produced more substantial \nchanges in the paradigm than the reformulations of the Principia cited \nabove. Such changes result from the empirical work previously \ndescribed as aimed at paradigm articulation. Indeed, to classify that sort \nof work as empirical was arbitrary. More than any other sort of normal \nresearch, the problems of paradigm articulation are simultaneously \ntheoretical and experimental; the examples given previously will serve \nequally well here. Before he could construct his equipment and make \nmeasurements with it, Coulomb had to employ electrical theory to \ndetermine how his equipment should be built.

Or \nagain, the men who designed the experiments that were to distinguish \nbetween the various theories of heating by compression were generally \nthe same men who had made up the versions being compared. They \nwere working both with fact and with theory, and their work produced \nnot simply new information but a more precise paradigm, obtained by \nthe elimination of ambiguities that the original from which they worked \nhad retained. In many sciences, most normal work is of this sort. These \nthree classes of problems\u2014determination of significant fact, matching of \nfacts with theory, and articulation of theory-exhaust, I think, the \nliterature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical. They do \nnot, of course, quite exhaust the entire literature of science. There are \nalso extraordinary problems, and it may well be their resolution that \nmakes the scientific enterprise as a whole so particularly worthwhile. \nBut extraordinary problems are not to be had for the asking. They \nemerge only on special occasions prepared by the advance of normal \nresearch. Inevitably, therefore, the overwhelming majority of the \nproblems undertaken by even the very best scientists usually fall into \none of the three categories outlined above. Work under the paradigm \ncan be conducted in no other way, and to desert the paradigm is to cease \npracticing the science it defines. We shall shortly discover that such \ndesertions do occur. They are the pivots about which scientific \nrevolutions turn. But before beginning the study of such revolutions, we \nrequire a more panoramic view of the normal-scientific pursuits that \nprepare the way. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n34 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIV.  Normal Science as Puzzle-solving \n\n \nPerhaps the most striking feature of the normal research problems we \n\nhave just encountered is how little they aim to produce major novelties, \nconceptual or phenomenal. Sometimes, as in a wave-length \nmeasurement, everything but the most esoteric detail of the result is \nknown in advance, and the typical latitude of expectation is only \nsomewhat wider. Coulomb\u2019s measurements need not, perhaps, have \nfitted an inverse square law; the men who worked on heating by \ncompression were often prepared for any one of several results. Yet even \nin cases like these the range of anticipated, and thus of assimilable, \nresults is always small compared with the range that imagination can \nconceive. And the project whose outcome does not fall in that narrower \nrange is usually just a research failure, one which reflects not on nature \nbut on the scientist. \n\nIn the eighteenth century, for example, little attention was paid to the \nexperiments that measured electrical attraction with devices like the \npan balance. Because they yielded neither consistent nor simple results, \nthey could not be used to articulate the paradigm from which they \nderived. Therefore, they remained mere facts, unrelated and unrelatable \nto the continuing progress of electrical research. Only in retrospect, \npossessed of a subsequent paradigm, can we see what characteristics of \nelectrical phenomena they display. Coulomb and his contemporaries, of \ncourse, also possessed this later paradigm or one that, when applied to \nthe problem of attraction, yielded the same expectations. That is why \nCoulomb was able to design apparatus that gave a result assimilable by \nparadigm articulation. But it is also why that result surprised no one and \nwhy several of Coulomb\u2019s contemporaries had been able to predict it in \nadvance. Even the project whose goal is paradigm articulation does not \naim at the unexpected novelty. \n\nBut if the aim of normal science is not major substantive novelties\u2014if \nfailure to come near the anticipated result is usually \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n35 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nfailure as a scientist\u2014then why are these problems undertaken at all? \nPart of the answer has already been developed. To scientists, at least, the \nresults gained in normal research are significant because they add to the \nscope and precision with which the paradigm can be applied. That \nanswer, however, cannot account for the enthusiasm and devotion that \nscientists display for the problems of normal research. No one devotes \nyears to, say, the development of a better spectrometer or the \nproduction of an improved solution to the problem of vibrating strings \nsimply because of the importance of the information that will be \nobtained. The data to be gained by computing ephemerides or by \nfurther measurements with an existing instrument are often just as \nsignificant, but those activities are regularly spurned by scientists \nbecause they are so largely repetitions of procedures that have been \ncarried through before. That rejection provides a clue to the fascination \nof the normal research problem. Though its outcome can be anticipated, \noften in detail so great that what remains to be known is itself \nuninteresting, the way to achieve that outcome remains very much in \ndoubt. Bringing a normal research problem to a conclusion is achieving \nthe anticipated in a new way, and it requires the solution of all sorts of \ncomplex instrumental, conceptual, and mathematical puzzles. The man \nwho succeeds proves himself an expert puzzle-solver, and the challenge \nof the puzzle is an important part of what usually drives him on. \n\nThe terms \u2018puzzle\u2019 and \u2018puzzle-solver\u2019 highlight several of the themes \nthat have become increasingly prominent in the preceding pages. \nPuzzles are, in the entirely standard meaning here employed, that \nspecial category of problems that can serve to test ingenuity or skill in \nsolution. Dictionary illustrations are \u2018jigsaw puzzle\u2019 and \u2018crossword \npuzzle,\u2019 and it is the characteristics that these share with the problems \nof normal science that we now need to isolate. One of them has just \nbeen mentioned. It is no criterion of goodness in a puzzle that its \noutcome be intrinsically interesting or important. On the contrary, the \nreally pressing problems, e.g., a cure for cancer or the design of a \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n36 \n\n\n\nNormal Science as Puzzle-solving \n \nlasting peace, are often not puzzles at all, largely because they may not \nhave any solution. Consider the jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are selected \nat random from each of two different puzzle boxes. Since that problem \nis likely to defy (though it might not) even the most ingenious of men, it \ncannot serve as a test of skill in solution. In any usual sense it is not a \npuzzle at all. Though intrinsic value is no criterion for a puzzle, the \nassured existence of a solution is. \n\nWe have already seen, however, that one of the things a scientific \ncommunity acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing \nproblems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed \nto have solutions. To a great extent these are the only problems that the \ncommunity will admit as scientific or encourage its members to \nundertake. Other problems, including many that had previously been \nstandard, are rejected as metaphysical, as the concern of another \ndiscipline, or sometimes as just too problematic to be worth the time. A \nparadigm can, for that matter, even insulate the community from those \nsocially important problems that are not reducible to the puzzle form, \nbecause they cannot be stated in terms of the conceptual and \ninstrumental tools the paradigm supplies. Such problems can be a \ndistraction, a lesson brilliantly illustrated by several facets of \nseventeenth-century Baconianism and by some of the contemporary \nsocial sciences. One of the reasons why normal science seems to \nprogress so rapidly is that its practitioners concentrate on problems that \nonly their own lack of ingenuity should keep them from solving. \n\nIf, however, the problems of normal science are puzzles in this sense, \nwe need no longer ask why scientists attack them with such passion and \ndevotion. A man may be attracted to science for all sorts of reasons. \nAmong them are the desire to be useful, the excitement of exploring \nnew territory, the hope of finding order, and the drive to test established \nknowledge. These motives and others besides also help to determine the \nparticular problems that will later engage him. Furthermore, though the \nresult is occasional frustration, there is good reason \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n37 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nwhy motives like these should first attract him and then lead him on.1 \nThe scientific enterprise as a whole does from time to time prove useful, \nopen up new territory, display order, and test long-accepted belief. \nNevertheless, the individual engaged on a normal research problem is \nalmost never doing any one of these things. Once engaged, his motivation \nis of a rather different sort. What then challenges him is the conviction \nthat, if only he is skilful enough, he will succeed in solving a puzzle that \nno one before has solved or solved so well. Many of the greatest \nscientific minds have devoted all of their professional attention to \ndemanding puzzles of this sort. On most occasions any particular field of \nspecialization offers nothing else to do, a fact that makes it no less \nfascinating to the proper sort of addict. \n\nTurn now to another, more difficult, and more revealing aspect of the \nparallelism between puzzles and the problems of normal science. If it is \nto classify as a puzzle, a problem must be characterized by more than an \nassured solution. There must also be rules that limit both the nature of \nacceptable solutions and the steps by which they are to be obtained. To \nsolve a jigsaw puzzle is not, for example, merely \u201cto make a picture.\u201d \nEither a child or a contemporary artist could do that by scattering \nselected pieces, as abstract shapes, upon some neutral ground. The \npicture thus produced might be far better, and would certainly be more \noriginal, than the one from which the puzzle had been made. \nNevertheless, such a picture would not be a solution. To achieve that all \nthe pieces must be used, their plain sides must be turned down, and \nthey must be interlocked without forcing until no holes remain. Those \nare among the rules that govern jigsaw-puzzle solutions. Similar \nrestrictions upon the admissible solutions of crossword puzzles, riddles, \nchess problems, and so on, are readily discovered. \n\nIf we can accept a considerably broadened use of the term \n \n\n1 The frustrations induced by the conflict between the individual\u2019s role and the over-all \npattern of scientific development can, however, occasionally be quite serious. On this \nsubject, see Lawrence S. Kubie, \u201cSome Unsolved Problems of the Scientific Career,\u201d \nAmerican Scientist, XLI (1953), 596-613; and XLII (1954), 104-12. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n38 \n\n\n\nNormal Science as Puzzle-solving \n \n\u2018rule\u2019\u2014one that will occasionally equate it with \u2018established viewpoint\u2019 or \nwith \u2018preconception\u2019\u2014then the problems accessible within a given \nresearch tradition display something much like this set of puzzle \ncharacteristics. The man who builds an instrument to determine optical \nwave lengths must not be satisfied with a piece of equipment that \nmerely attributes particular numbers to particular spectral lines. He is \nnot just an explorer or measurer. On the contrary, he must show, by \nanalyzing his apparatus in terms of the established body of optical \ntheory, that the numbers his instrument produces are the ones that \nenter theory as wave lengths. If some residual vagueness in the theory \nor some unanalyzed component of his apparatus prevents his \ncompleting that demonstration, his colleagues may well conclude that \nhe has measured nothing at all. For example, the electron-scattering \nmaxima that were later diagnosed as indices of electron wave length had \nno apparent significance when first observed and recorded. Before they \nbecame measures of anything, they had to be related to a theory that \npredicted the wave-like behavior of matter in motion. And even after \nthat relation was pointed out, the apparatus had to be redesigned so that \nthe experimental results might be correlated unequivocally with \ntheory.2 Until those conditions had been satisfied, no problem had been \nsolved. \n\nSimilar sorts of restrictions bound the admissible solutions to \ntheoretical problems. Throughout the eighteenth century those \nscientists who tried to derive the observed motion of the moon from \nNewton\u2019s laws of motion and gravitation consistently failed to do so. As \na result, some of them suggested replacing the inverse square law with a \nlaw that deviated from it at small distances. To do that, however, would \nhave been to change the paradigm, to define a new puzzle, and not to \nsolve the old one. In the event, scientists preserved the rules until, in \n1750, one of them discovered how they could successfully be applied.3 \n \n\n2 For a brief account of the evolution of these experiments, see page 4 of C. J. Davisson\u2019s \nlecture in Les prix Nobel en 1937 (Stockholm, 1938). \n3 W. Whewell, History of the Inductive Sciences (rev. ed.; London, 1847), II, 101-5, 220-22. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n39 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nOnly a change in the rules of the game could have provided an \nalternative. \n\nThe study of normal-scientific traditions discloses many additional \nrules, and these provide much information about the commitments that \nscientists derive from their paradigms. What can we say are the main \ncategories into which these rules fall?4 The most obvious and probably \nthe most binding is exemplified by the sorts of generalizations we have \njust noted. These are explicit statements of scientific law and about \nscientific concepts and theories. While they continue to be honored, \nsuch statements help to set puzzles and to limit acceptable solutions. \nNewton\u2019s Laws, for example, performed those functions during the \neighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As long as they did so, quantity-of-\nmatter was a fundamental ontological category for physical scientists, \nand the forces that act between bits of matter were a dominant topic for \nresearch.5 In chemistry the laws of fixed and definite proportions had, \nfor a long time, an exactly similar force\u2014setting the problem of atomic \nweights, bounding the admissible results of chemical analyses, and \ninforming chemists what atoms and molecules, compounds and \nmixtures were.6 Maxwell\u2019s equations and the laws of statistical \nthermodynamics have the same hold and function today. \n\nRules like these are, however, neither the only nor even the most \ninteresting variety displayed by historical study. At a level lower or more \nconcrete than that of laws and theories, there is, for example, a \nmultitude of commitments to preferred types of instrumentation and to \nthe ways in which accepted instruments may legitimately be employed. \nChanging attitudes toward the role of fire in chemical analyses played a \nvital part in the de- \n \n\n4 I owe this question to W. O. Hagstrom, whose work in the sociology of science \nsometimes overlaps my own. \n5 For these aspects of Newtonianism, see I. B. Cohen, Franklin and Newton: An Inquiry \ninto Speculative Newtonian Experimental Science and Franklin\u2019s Work in Electricity as an \nExample Thereof (Philadelphia, 1956), chap, vii, esp. pp. 255-57, 275-77. \n6  This example is discussed at length near the end of Section X.  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n40 \n\n\n\nNormal Science as Puzzle-solving \n \nvelopment of chemistry in the seventeenth century.7 Helmholtz, in the \nnineteenth, encountered strong resistance from physiologists to the \nnotion that physical experimentation could illuminate their field.8 And \nin this century the curious history of chemical chromatography again \nillustrates the endurance of instrumental commitments that, as much as \nlaws and theory, provide scientists with rules of the game.9 When we \nanalyze the discovery of X-rays, we shall find reasons for commitments \nof this sort. \n\nLess local and temporary, though still not unchanging characteristics \nof science, are the higher level, quasi-metaphysical commitments that \nhistorical study so regularly displays. After about 1630, for example, and \nparticularly after the appearance of Descartes\u2019s immensely influential \nscientific writings, most physical scientists assumed that the universe \nwas composed of microscopic corpuscles and that all natural \nphenomena could be explained in terms of corpuscular shape, size, \nmotion, and interaction. That nest of commitments proved to be both \nmetaphysical and methodological. As metaphysical, it told scientists \nwhat sorts of entities the universe did and did not contain: there was \nonly shaped matter in motion. As methodological, it told them what \nultimate laws and fundamental explanations must be like: laws must \nspecify corpuscular motion and interaction, and explanation must \nreduce any given natural phenomenon to corpuscular action under \nthese laws. More important still, the corpuscular conception of the \nuniverse told scientists what many of their research problems should be. \nFor example, a chemist who, like Boyle, embraced the new philosophy \ngave particular attention to reactions that could be viewed as \ntransmutations. More clearly than any others these displayed the \nprocess of corpuscular rearrangement that must underlie all \n \n\n7 H. Metzger, Les doctrines chimiques en France du d\u00e9but du XVIIe si\u00e8cle \u00e0 la fin du XVIIIe \nsi\u00e8cle (Paris, 1923), pp. 359-61; Marie Boas, Robert Boyle and Seventeenth-Century \nChemistry (Cambridge, 1958), pp. 112-15. \n8 Leo Konigsberger, Hermann von Helmholtz, trans.

The scientist must, for example, be \nconcerned to understand the world and to extend the precision and \nscope with which it has been ordered. That commitment must, in turn, \nlead him to scrutinize, either for himself or through colleagues, some \naspect of nature in great empirical detail. And, if that scrutiny displays \npockets of apparent disorder, then these must challenge him to a new \nrefinement of his observational techniques or to a further articulation of \nhis theories. Undoubtedly there are still other rules like these, ones \nwhich have held for scientists at all times. \n\nThe existence of this strong network of commitments\u2014conceptual, \ntheoretical, instrumental, and methodological\u2014is a principal source of \nthe metaphor that relates normal science to puzzle-solving. Because it \nprovides rules that tell the practitioner of a mature specialty what both \nthe world and his science are like, he can concentrate with assurance \nupon the esoteric problems that these rules and existing knowledge \ndefine for him. What then personally challenges him is how to bring the \nresidual puzzle to a solution. In these and other respects a discussion of \npuzzles and of rules illuminates the nature of normal scientific practice. \nYet, in another way, that illumination may be significantly misleading. \nThough there obviously are rules to which all the practitioners of a \nscientific specialty adhere at a given time, those rules may not by \nthemselves specify all that the practice of those specialists has in \ncommon. Normal science is a highly determined activity, but it need not \nbe entirely determined by rules. That is why, at the start of this essay, I \nintroduced shared paradigms rather than shared rules, assumptions, \nand points of view as the source of coherence for normal research \ntraditions. Rules, I suggest, derive from paradigms, but paradigms can \nguide research even in the absence of rules. \n \n10 For corpuscularism in general, see Marie Boas, \u201cThe Establishment of the Mechanical \nPhilosophy,\u201d Osiris, X (1952), 412-541. For its effects on Boyle\u2019s chemistry, see T. S. Kuhn, \n\u201cRobert Boyle and Structural Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century,\u201d Isis, XLIII (1952), \n12-36. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n42 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\nV.  The Priority of Paradigms \n \nTo discover the relation between rules, paradigms, and normal \n\nscience, consider first how the historian isolates the particular loci of \ncommitment that have just been described as accepted rules. Close \nhistorical investigation of a given specialty at a given time discloses a set \nof recurrent and quasi-standard illustrations of various theories in their \nconceptual, observational, and instrumental applications. These are the \ncommunity\u2019s paradigms, revealed in its textbooks, lectures, and \nlaboratory exercises. By studying them and by practicing with them, the \nmembers of the corresponding community learn their trade. The \nhistorian, of course, will discover in addition a penumbral area occupied \nby achievements whose status is still in doubt, but the core of solved \nproblems and techniques will usually be clear. Despite occasional \nambiguities, the paradigms of a mature scientific community can be \ndetermined with relative ease. \n\nThe determination of shared paradigms is not, however, the \ndetermination of shared rules. That demands a second step and one of a \nsomewhat different kind. When undertaking it, the historian must \ncompare the community\u2019s paradigms with each other and with its \ncurrent research reports. In doing so, his object is to discover what \nisolable elements, explicit or implicit, the members of that community \nmay have abstracted from their more global paradigms and deployed as \nrules in their research. Anyone who has attempted to describe or \nanalyze the evolution of a particular scientific tradition will necessarily \nhave sought accepted principles and rules of this sort. Almost certainly, \nas the preceding section indicates, he will have met with at least partial \nsuccess. But, if his experience has been at all like my own, he will have \nfound the search for rules both more difficult and less satisfying than \nthe search for paradigms. Some of the generalizations he employs to \ndescribe the community\u2019s shared beliefs will present no problems. \nOthers, however, in- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n43 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\neluding some of those used as illustrations above, will seem a shade too \nstrong. Phrased in just that way, or in any other way he can imagine, \nthey would almost certainly have been rejected by some members of the \ngroup he studies. Nevertheless, if the coherence of the research \ntradition is to be understood in terms of rules, some specification of \ncommon ground in the corresponding area is needed. As a result, the \nsearch for a body of rules competent to constitute a given normal \nresearch tradition becomes a source of continual and deep frustration. \n\nRecognizing that frustration, however, makes it possible to diagnose \nits source. Scientists can agree that a Newton, Lavoisier, Maxwell, or \nEinstein has produced an apparently permanent solution to a group of \noutstanding problems and still disagree, sometimes without being aware \nof it, about the particular abstract characteristics that make those \nsolutions permanent. They can, that is, agree in their identification of a \nparadigm without agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a full \ninterpretation or rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or \nof an agreed reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from \nguiding research. Normal science can be determined in part by the \ndirect inspection of paradigms, a process that is often aided by but does \nnot depend upon the formulation of rules and assumptions. Indeed, the \nexistence of a paradigm need not even imply that any full set of rules \nexists.1 \n\nInevitably, the first effect of those statements is to raise problems. In \nthe absence of a competent body of rules, what restricts the scientist to a \nparticular normal-scientific tradition? What can the phrase \u2018direct \ninspection of paradigms\u2019 mean? Partial answers to questions like these \nwere developed by the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, though in a very \ndifferent context. Because that context is both more elementary and \nmore familiar, it will help to consider his form of the argument first. \nWhat need we know, Wittgenstein asked, in order that we \n \n\n1 Michael Polanyi has brilliantly developed a very similar theme, arguing that much of \nthe scientist\u2019s success depends upon \u201ctacit knowledge,\u201d i.e., upon knowledge that is \nacquired through practice and that cannot be articulated explicitly. See his Personal \nKnowledge (Chicago, 1958), particularly chaps, v and vi. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n44 \n\n\n\nThe Priority of Paradigms \n \napply terms like \u2018chair,\u2019 or \u2018leaf,\u2019 or \u2018game\u2019 unequivocally and without \nprovoking argument?2 \n\nThat question is very old and has generally been answered by saying \nthat we must know, consciously or intuitively, what a chair, or leaf, or \ngame is. We must, that is, grasp some set of attributes that all games and \nthat only games have in common. Wittgenstein, however, concluded \nthat, given the way we use language and the sort of world to which we \napply it, there need be no such set of characteristics. Though a \ndiscussion of some of the attributes shared by a number of games or \nchairs or leaves often helps us learn how to employ the corresponding \nterm, there is no set of characteristics that is simultaneously applicable \nto all members of the class and to them alone. Instead, confronted with \na previously unobserved activity, we apply the term \u2018game\u2019 because what \nwe are seeing bears a close \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d to a number of the \nactivities that we have previously learned to call by that name. For \nWittgenstein, in short, games, and chairs, and leaves are natural \nfamilies, each constituted by a network of overlapping and crisscross \nresemblances. The existence of such a network sufficiently accounts for \nour success in identifying the corresponding object or activity. Only if \nthe families we named overlapped and merged gradually into one \nanother\u2014only, that is, if there were no natural families-would our \nsuccess in identifying and naming provide evidence for a set of common \ncharacteristics corresponding to each of the class names we employ. \n\nSomething of the same sort may very well hold for the various \nresearch problems and techniques that arise within a single normal-\nscientific tradition. What these have in common is not that they satisfy \nsome explicit or even some fully discoverable set of rules and \nassumptions that gives the tradition its character and its hold upon the \nscientific mind. Instead, they may relate by resemblance and by \nmodeling to one or another part of the scientific corpus which the \ncommunity in question al- \n \n\n2 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (New York, \n1953), pp. 31-36. Wittgenstein, however, says almost nothing about the sort of world \nnecessary to support the naming procedure he outlines. Part of the point that follows \ncannot therefore be attributed to him. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n45 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nready recognizes as among its established achievements. Scientists work \nfrom models acquired through education and through subsequent \nexposure to the literature often without quite knowing or needing to \nknow what characteristics have given these models the status of \ncommunity paradigms. And because they do so, they need no full set of \nrules. The coherence displayed by the research tradition in which they \nparticipate may not imply even the existence of an underlying body of \nrules and assumptions that additional historical or philosophical \ninvestigation might uncover. That scientists do not usually ask or debate \nwhat makes a particular problem or solution legitimate tempts us to \nsuppose that, at least intuitively, they know the answer. But it may only \nindicate that neither the question nor the answer is felt to be relevant to \ntheir research. Paradigms may be prior to, more binding, and more \ncomplete than any set of rules for research that could be unequivocally \nabstracted from them. So far this point has been entirely theoretical: \nparadigms could determine normal science without the intervention of \ndiscoverable rules. Let me now try to increase both its clarity and \nurgency by indicating some of the reasons for believing that paradigms \nactually do operate in this manner. The first, which has already been \ndiscussed quite fully, is the severe difficulty of discovering the rules that \nhave guided particular normal-scientific traditions. That difficulty is \nvery nearly the same as the one the philosopher encounters when he \ntries to say what all games have in common. The second, to which the \nfirst is really a corollary, is rooted in the nature of scientific education. \nScientists, it should already be clear, never learn concepts, laws, and \ntheories in the abstract and by themselves. Instead, these intellectual \ntools are from the start encountered in a historically and pedagogically \nprior unit that displays them with and through their applications. A new \ntheory is always announced together with applications to some concrete \nrange of natural phenomena; without them it would not be even a \ncandidate for acceptance. After it has been accepted, those same \napplications or others accompany the theory into the textbooks from \nwhich the future practitioner will learn his trade. They are not there \nmerely as  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n46 \n\n\n\nThe Priority of Paradigms \n \nembroidery or even as documentation. On the contrary, the process of \nlearning a theory depends upon the study of applications, including \npractice problem-solving both with a pencil and paper and with \ninstruments in the laboratory. If, for example, the student of Newtonian \ndynamics ever discovers the meaning of terms like \u2018force,\u2019 \u2018mass,\u2019 \u2018space,\u2019 \nand \u2018time,\u2019 he does so less from the incomplete though sometimes \nhelpful definitions in his text than by observing and participating in the \napplication of these concepts to problem-solution. \n\nThat process of learning by finger exercise or by doing continues \nthroughout the process of professional initiation. As the student \nproceeds from his freshman course to and through his doctoral \ndissertation, the problems assigned to him become more complex and \nless completely precedented. But they continue to be closely modeled \non previous achievements as are the problems that normally occupy \nhim during his subsequent independent scientific career. One is at \nliberty to suppose that somewhere along the way the scientist has \nintuitively abstracted rules of the game for himself, but there is little \nreason to believe it. Though many scientists talk easily and well about \nthe particular individual hypotheses that underlie a concrete piece of \ncurrent research, they are little better than laymen at characterizing the \nestablished bases of their field, its legitimate problems and methods. If \nthey have learned such abstractions at all, they show it mainly through \ntheir ability to do successful research. That ability can, however, be \nunderstood without recourse to hypothetical rules of the game. \n\nThese consequences of scientific education have a converse that \nprovides a third reason to suppose that paradigms guide research by \ndirect modeling as well as through abstracted rules. Normal science can \nproceed without rules only so long as the relevant scientific community \naccepts without question the particular problem-solutions already \nachieved. Rules should therefore become important and the \ncharacteristic unconcern about them should vanish whenever \nparadigms or models are felt to be insecure. That is, moreover, exactly \nwhat does occur. The pre-paradigm period, in particular, is regularly \nmarked by frequent \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n47 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nand deep debates over legitimate methods, problems, and standards of \nsolution, though these serve rather to define schools than to produce \nagreement. We have already noted a few of these debates in optics and \nelectricity, and they played an even larger role in the development of \nseventeenth-century chemistry and of early nineteenth-century \ngeology.3 Furthermore, debates like these do not vanish once and for all \nwith the appearance of a paradigm. Though almost non-existent during \nperiods of normal science, they recur regularly just before and during \nscientific revolutions, the periods when paradigms are first under attack \nand then subject to change. The transition from Newtonian to quantum \nmechanics evoked many debates about both the nature and the \nstandards of physics, some of which still continue.4 There are people \nalive today who can remember the similar arguments engendered by \nMaxwell\u2019s electromagnetic theory and by statistical mechanics.5 And \nearlier still, the assimilation of Galileo\u2019s and Newton\u2019s mechanics gave \nrise to a particularly famous series of debates with Aristotelians, \nCartesians, and Leibnizians about the standards legitimate to science.6 \nWhen scientists disagree about whether the fundamental problems of \ntheir field have been solved, the search for rules gains a function that it \ndoes not ordinarily possess.

The \nintroduction to this essay suggested that there can be small revolutions \nas well as large ones, that some revolutions affect only the members of a \nprofessional subspecialty, and that for such groups even the discovery of \na new and unexpected phenomenon may be revolutionary. The next \nsection will introduce selected revolutions of that sort, and it is still far \nfrom clear how they can exist. If normal science is so rigid and if \nscientific communities are so close-knit as the preceding discussion has \nimplied, how can a change of paradigm ever affect only a small \nsubgroup? What has been said so far may have seemed to imply that \nnormal science is a single monolithic and unified enterprise that must \nstand or fall with any one of its paradigms as well as with all of them \ntogether. But science is obviously seldom or never like that. Often, \nviewing all fields together, it seems instead a rather ramshackle \nstructure with little coherence among its various parts. Nothing said to \nthis point should, however, conflict with that very familiar observation. \nOn the contrary, substituting paradigms for rules should make the \ndiversity of scientific fields and specialties easier to understand. Explicit \nrules, when they exist, are usually common to a very broad scientific \ngroup, but paradigms need not be. The practitioners of widely separated \nfields, say astronomy and taxonomic botany, are educated by exposure \nto quite different achievements described in very different books. And \neven men who, being in the same or in closely related fields, begin by \nstudying many of the same books and achievements may acquire rather \ndifferent paradigms in the course of professional specialization. \n\nConsider, for a single example, the quite large and diverse community \nconstituted by all physical scientists. Each member of that group today \nis taught the laws of, say, quantum mechanics, and most of them employ \nthese laws at some point in \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n49 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ntheir research or teaching. But they do not all learn the same \napplications of these laws, and they are not therefore all affected in the \nsame ways by changes in quantum-mechanical practice. On the road to \nprofessional specialization, a few physical scientists encounter only the \nbasic principles of quantum mechanics. Others study in detail the \nparadigm applications of these principles to chemistry, still others to the \nphysics of the solid state, and so on. What quantum mechanics means to \neach of them depends upon what courses he has had, what texts he has \nread, and which journals he studies. It follows that, though a change in \nquantum-mechanical law will be revolutionary for all of these groups, a \nchange that reflects only on one or another of the paradigm applications \nof quantum mechanics need be revolutionary only for the members of a \nparticular professional subspecialty. For the rest of the profession and \nfor those who practice other physical sciences, that change need not be \nrevolutionary at all. In short, though quantum mechanics (or \nNewtonian dynamics, or electromagnetic theory) is a paradigm for \nmany scientific groups, it is not the same paradigm for them all. \nTherefore, it can simultaneously determine several traditions of normal \nscience that overlap without being coextensive. A revolution produced \nwithin one of these traditions will not necessarily extend to the others as \nwell. \n\nOne brief illustration of specialization\u2019s effect may give this whole \nseries of points additional force. An investigator who hoped to learn \nsomething about what scientists took the atomic theory to be asked a \ndistinguished physicist and an eminent chemist whether a single atom \nof helium was or was not a molecule. Both answered without hesitation, \nbut their answers were not the same. For the chemist the atom of \nhelium was a molecule because it behaved like one with respect to the \nkinetic theory of gases. For the physicist, on the other hand, the helium \natom was not a molecule because it displayed no molecular spectrum.7 \nPresumably both men were talking of the same par- \n \n\n7 The investigator was James K. Senior, to whom I am indebted for a verbal \nreport. Some related issues are treated in his paper, \u201cThe Vernacular of the \nLaboratory,\u201d Philosophy of Science, XXV (1958), 163-68. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n50 \n\n\n\nThe Priority of Paradigms \n \nticle, but they were viewing it through their own research training and \npractice. Their experience in problem-solving told them what a \nmolecule must be. Undoubtedly their experiences had had much in \ncommon, but they did not, in this case, tell the two specialists the same \nthing. As we proceed we shall discover how consequential paradigm \ndifferences of this sort can occasionally be. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n51 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nVI. Anomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n\n \nNormal science, the puzzle-solving activity we have just examined, is \n\na highly cumulative enterprise, eminently successful in its aim, the \nsteady extension of the scope and precision of scientific knowledge. In \nall these respects it fits with great precision the most usual image of \nscientific work. Yet one standard product of the scientific enterprise is \nmissing. Normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and, \nwhen successful, finds none. New and unsuspected phenomena are, \nhowever, repeatedly uncovered by scientific research, and radical new \ntheories have again and again been invented by scientists. History even \nsuggests that the scientific enterprise has developed a uniquely powerful \ntechnique for producing surprises of this sort. If this characteristic of \nscience is to be reconciled with what has already been said, then \nresearch under a paradigm must be a particularly effective way of \ninducing paradigm change. That is what fundamental novelties of fact \nand theory do. Produced inadvertently by a game played under one set \nof rules, their assimilation requires the elaboration of another set. After \nthey have become parts of science, the enterprise, at least of those \nspecialists in whose particular field the novelties lie, is never quite the \nsame again. \nWe must now ask how changes of this sort can come about, considering \nfirst discoveries, or novelties of fact, and then inventions, or novelties of \ntheory. That distinction between discovery and invention or between \nfact and theory will, however, immediately prove to be exceedingly \nartificial. Its artificiality is an important clue to several of this essay\u2019s \nmain theses. Examining selected discoveries in the rest of this section, \nwe shall quickly find that they are not isolated events but extended \nepisodes with a regularly recurrent structure. Discovery commences \nwith the awareness of anomaly, i.e., with the recognition that nature has \nsomehow violated the paradigm-induced  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n52 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \nexpectations that govern normal science. It then continues with a more \nor less extended exploration of the area of anomaly. And it closes only \nwhen the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has \nbecome the expected. Assimilating a new sort of fact demands a more \nthan additive adjustment of theory, and until that adjustment is \ncompleted\u2014until the scientist has learned to see nature in a different \nway\u2014the new fact is not quite a scientific fact at all. \n\nTo see how closely factual and theoretical novelty are intertwined in \nscientific discovery examine a particularly famous example, the \ndiscovery of oxygen. At least three different men have a legitimate claim \nto it, and several other chemists must, in the early 1770\u2019s, have had \nenriched air in a laboratory vessel without knowing it.1 The progress of \nnormal science, in this case of pneumatic chemistry, prepared the way \nto a breakthrough quite thoroughly. The earliest of the claimants to \nprepare a relatively pure sample of the gas was the Swedish apothecary, \nC. W. Scheele. We may, however, ignore his work since it was not \npublished until oxygen\u2019s discovery had repeatedly been announced \nelsewhere and thus had no effect upon the historical pattern that most \nconcerns us here.2 The second in time to establish a claim was the \nBritish scientist and divine, Joseph Priestley, who collected the gas \nreleased by heated red oxide of mercury as one item in a prolonged \nnormal investigation of the \u201cairs\u201d evolved by a large number of solid \nsubstances. In 1774 he identified the gas thus produced as nitrous oxide \nand in 1775, led by further tests, as common air with less than its usual \nquantity of phlogiston. The third claimant, Lavoisier, started the work \nthat led him to oxygen after Priestley\u2019s experiments of 1774 and possibly \nas the result of a hint from Priestley. Early in \n \n\n1 For the still classic discussion of oxygen\u2019s discovery, see A. N.

Was it Priestley or Lavoisier, if either, who first discovered \noxygen? In any case, when was oxygen discovered? In that form the \nquestion could be asked even if only one claimant had existed. As a \nruling about priority and date, an answer does not at all concern us. \nNevertheless, an attempt to produce one will illuminate the nature of \ndiscovery, because there is no answer of the kind that is sought. \nDiscovery is not the sort of process about which the question is \nappropriately asked. The fact that it is asked\u2014the priority for oxygen has \nrepeatedly been contested since the 1780\u2019s\u2014is a symptom of something \naskew in the image of science that gives discovery so fundamental a role. \nLook once more at our example. Priestley\u2019s claim to the discovery of \noxygen is based upon his priority in isolating a gas that was later \nrecognized as a distinct species. But Priestley\u2019s sample was not pure, \nand, if holding impure oxygen in one\u2019s hands is to discover it, that had \nbeen done by everyone who ever bottled atmospheric air. Besides, if \nPriestley was the discoverer, when was the discovery made? In 1774 he \nthought he had obtained nitrous oxide, a species he already knew; in \n1775 he saw the gas as dephlogisticated air, which is still not oxygen or \neven, for phlogistic chemists, a quite unexpected sort of gas. Lavoisier\u2019s \nclaim may be stronger, but it presents the same problems. If we refuse \nthe palm to Priestley, we cannot award it to Lavoisier for the work of \n1775 which led \n \n\n3 J. B.

This very useful pamphlet reprints many of the relevant \ndocuments. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n54 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \nhim to identify the gas as the \u201cair itself entire.\u201d Presumably we wait for \nthe work of 1776 and 1777 which led Lavoisier to see not merely the gas \nbut what the gas was. Yet even this award could be questioned, for in \n1777 and to the end of his life Lavoisier insisted that oxygen was an \natomic \u201cprinciple of acidity\u201d and that oxygen gas was formed only when \nthat \u201cprinciple\u201d united with caloric, the matter of heat.4 Shall we \ntherefore say that oxygen had not yet been discovered in 1777? Some \nmay be tempted to do so. But the principle of acidity was not banished \nfrom chemistry until after 1810, and caloric lingered until the 1860\u2019s. \nOxygen had become a standard chemical substance before either of \nthose dates. \n\nClearly we need a new vocabulary and concepts for analyzing events \nlike the discovery of oxygen. Though undoubtedly correct, the sentence, \n\u201cOxygen was discovered,\u201d misleads by suggesting that discovering \nsomething is a single simple act assimilable to our usual (and also \nquestionable) concept of seeing. That is why we so readily assume that \ndiscovering, like seeing or touching, should be unequivocally \nattributable to an individual and to a moment in time. But the latter \nattribution is always impossible, and the former often is as well. \nIgnoring Scheele, we can safely say that oxygen had not been discovered \nbefore 1774, and we would probably also say that it had been discovered \nby 1777 or shortly thereafter. But within those limits or others like \nthem, any attempt to date the discovery must inevitably be arbitrary \nbecause discovering a new sort of phenomenon is necessarily a complex \nevent, one which involves recognizing both that something is and what it \nis. Note, for example, that if oxygen were dephlogisticated air for us, we \nshould insist without hesitation that Priestley had discovered it, though \nwe would still not know quite when. But if both observation and \nconceptualization, fact and assimilation to theory, are inseparably linked \nin discovery, then discovery is a process and must take time. Only when \nall the relevant conceptual categories are prepared in advance, in which \ncase the phenomenon would not \n \n\n4 H. Metzger, La philosophie de la mati\u00e8re chez Lavoisier (Paris, 1935); and Daumas, \nop. cit., chap. vii. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n55 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nbe of a new sort, can discovering that and discovering what occur \neffortlessly, together, and in an instant. \n\nGrant now that discovery involves an extended, though not \nnecessarily long, process of conceptual assimilation. Can we also say that \nit involves a change in paradigm? To that question, no general answer \ncan yet be given, but in this case at least, the answer must be yes. What \nLavoisier announced in his papers from 1777 on was not so much the \ndiscovery of oxygen as the oxygen theory of combustion. That theory \nwas the keystone for a reformulation of chemistry so vast that it is \nusually called the chemical revolution. Indeed, if the discovery of \noxygen had not been an intimate part of the emergence of a new \nparadigm for chemistry, the question of priority from which we began \nwould never have seemed so important. In this case as in others, the \nvalue placed upon a new phenomenon and thus upon its discoverer \nvaries with our estimate of the extent to which the phenomenon \nviolated paradigm-induced anticipations. Notice, however, since it will \nbe important later, that the discovery of oxygen was not by itself the \ncause of the change in chemical theory. Long before he played any part \nin the discovery of the new gas, Lavoisier was convinced both that \nsomething was wrong with the phlogiston theory and that burning \nbodies absorbed some part of the atmosphere. That much he had \nrecorded in a sealed note deposited with the Secretary of the French \nAcademy in 1772.5 What the work on oxygen did was to give much \nadditional form and structure to Lavoisier\u2019s earlier sense that something \nwas amiss. It told him a thing he was already prepared to discover\u2014the \nnature of the substance that combustion removes from the atmosphere. \nThat advance awareness of difficulties must be a significant part of what \nenabled Lavoisier to see in experiments like Priestley\u2019s a gas that \nPriestley had been unable to see there himself. Conversely, the fact that \na major paradigm revision was needed to see what Lavoisier saw must be \nthe principal reason why Priestley was, to the end of his long life, unable \nto see it. \n \n\n5 The most authoritative account of the origin of Lavoisier\u2019s discontent is Henry \nGuerlac, Lavoisier\u2014the Crucial Year: The Background and Origin of His First \nExperiments on Combustion in 1772 (Ithaca, N.Y., 1961). \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n56 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \nTwo other and far briefer examples will reinforce much that has just \n\nbeen said and simultaneously carry us from an elucidation of the nature \nof discoveries toward an understanding of the circumstances under \nwhich they emerge in science. In an effort to represent the main ways in \nwhich discoveries can come about, these examples are chosen to be \ndifferent both from each other and from the discovery of oxygen. The \nfirst, X-rays, is a classic case of discovery through accident, a type that \noccurs more frequently than the impersonal standards of scientific \nreporting allow us easily to realize. Its story opens on the day that the \nphysicist Roentgen interrupted a normal investigation of cathode rays \nbecause he had noticed that a barium platino-cyanide screen at some \ndistance from his shielded apparatus glowed when the discharge was in \nprocess. Further investigations\u2014they required seven hectic weeks \nduring which Roentgen rarely left the laboratory\u2014indicated that the \ncause of the glow came in straight lines from the cathode ray tube, that \nthe radiation cast shadows, could not be deflected by a magnet, and \nmuch else besides. Before announcing his discovery, Roentgen had \nconvinced himself that his effect was not due to cathode rays but to an \nagent with at least some similarity to light.6 \n\nEven so brief an epitome reveals striking resemblances to the \ndiscovery of oxygen: before experimenting with red oxide of mercury, \nLavoisier had performed experiments that did not produce the results \nanticipated under the phlogiston paradigm; Roentgen\u2019s discovery \ncommenced with the recognition that his screen glowed when it should \nnot. In both cases the perception of anomaly\u2014of a phenomenon, that is, \nfor which his paradigm had not readied the investigator\u2014played an \nessential role in preparing the way for perception of novelty. But, again \nin both cases, the perception that something had gone wrong was only \nthe prelude to discovery. Neither oxygen nor X-rays emerged without a \nfurther process of experimentation and assimilation. At what point in \nRoentgen\u2019s investigation, for example, ought we say that X-rays had \nactually been discovered? Not, in any \n \n\n6 L. W. Taylor, Physics, the Pioneer Science (Boston, 1941), pp. 790-94; and T. W. \nChalmers, Historic Researches (London, 1949), pp. 218-19.  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n57 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ncase, at the first instant, when all that had been noted was a glowing \nscreen. At least one other investigator had seen that glow and, to his \nsubsequent chagrin, discovered nothing at all.7 Nor, it is almost as clear, \ncan the moment of discovery be pushed forward to a point during the \nlast week of investigation, by which time Roentgen was exploring the \nproperties of the new radiation he had already discovered. We can only \nsay that X-rays emerged in W\u00fcrzburg between November 8 and \nDecember 28, 1895. \n\nIn a third area, however, the existence of significant parallels between \nthe discoveries of oxygen and of X-rays is far less apparent. Unlike the \ndiscovery of oxygen, that of X-rays was not, at least for a decade after the \nevent, implicated in any obvious upheaval in scientific theory. In what \nsense, then, can the assimilation of that discovery be said to have \nnecessitated paradigm change? The case for denying such a change is \nvery strong. To be sure, the paradigms subscribed to by Roentgen and \nhis contemporaries could not have been used to predict X-rays. \n(Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic theory had not yet been accepted \neverywhere, and the particulate theory of cathode rays was only one of \nseveral current speculations.) But neither did those paradigms, at least \nin any obvious sense, prohibit the existence of X-rays as the phlogiston \ntheory had prohibited Lavoisier\u2019s interpretation of Priestley\u2019s gas. On the \ncontrary, in 1895 accepted scientific theory and practice admitted a \nnumber of forms of radiation\u2014visible, infrared, and ultraviolet. Why \ncould not X-rays have been accepted as just one more form of a well-\nknown class of natural phenomena? Why were they not, for example, \nreceived in the same way as the discovery of an additional chemical \nelement? New elements to fill empty places in the periodic table were \nstill being sought and found in Roentgen\u2019s day. Their pursuit was a \nstandard project for normal science, and success was an occasion only \nfor congratulations, not for surprise. \n \n\n7 E. T. Whittaker, A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, I (2d ed.; \nLondon, 1951), 358, n. 1. Sir George Thomson has informed me of a second near \nmiss. Alerted by unaccountably fogged photographic plates, Sir William Crookes \nwas also on the track of the discovery. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n58 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \nX-rays, however, were greeted not only with surprise but with shock. \n\nLord Kelvin at first pronounced them an elaborate hoax.8 Others, \nthough they could not doubt the evidence, were clearly staggered by it. \nThough X-rays were not prohibited by established theory, they violated \ndeeply entrenched expectations. Those expectations, I suggest, were \nimplicit in the design and interpretation of established laboratory \nprocedures. By the 1890\u2019s cathode ray equipment was widely deployed \nin numerous European laboratories. If Roentgen\u2019s apparatus had \nproduced X-rays, then a number of other experimentalists must for \nsome time have been producing those rays without knowing it. Perhaps \nthose rays, which might well have other unacknowledged sources too, \nwere implicated in behavior previously explained without reference to \nthem. At the very least, several sorts of long familiar apparatus would in \nthe future have to be shielded with lead. Previously completed work on \nnormal projects would now have to be done again because earlier \nscientists had failed to recognize and control a relevant variable. X-rays, \nto be sure, opened up a new field and thus added to the potential \ndomain of normal science. But they also, and this is now the more \nimportant point, changed fields that had already existed. In the process \nthey denied previously paradigmatic types of instrumentation their \nright to that title. \n\nIn short, consciously or not, the decision to employ a particular piece \nof apparatus and to use it in a particular way carries an assumption that \nonly certain sorts of circumstances will arise. There are instrumental as \nwell as theoretical expectations, and they have often played a decisive \nrole in scientific development. One such expectation is, for example, \npart of the story of oxygen\u2019s belated discovery. Using a standard test for \n\u201cthe goodness of air,\u201d both Priestley and Lavoisier mixed two volumes of \ntheir gas with one volume of nitric oxide, shook the mixture over water, \nand measured the volume of the gaseous residue. The previous \nexperience from which this standard procedure had evolved assured \nthem that with atmospheric air the residue \n \n\n8 Silvanus P. Thompson, The Life of Sir William Thomson Baron Kelvin of Largs \n(London, 1910), II, 1125. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n59 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nwould be one volume and that for any other gas (or for polluted air) it \nwould be greater. In the oxygen experiments both found a residue close \nto one volume and identified the gas accordingly. Only much later and \nin part through an accident did Priestley renounce the standard \nprocedure and try mixing nitric oxide with his gas in other proportions. \nHe then found that with quadruple the volume of nitric oxide there was \nalmost no residue at all. His commitment to the original test procedure\u2014\na procedure sanctioned by much previous experience\u2014had been \nsimultaneously a commitment to the non-existence of gases that could \nbehave as oxygen did.9 \n\nIllustrations of this sort could be multiplied by reference, for \nexample, to the belated identification of uranium fission. One reason \nwhy that nuclear reaction proved especially difficult to recognize was \nthat men who knew what to expect when bombarding uranium chose \nchemical tests aimed mainly at elements from the upper end of the \nperiodic table.10 Ought we conclude from the frequency with which \nsuch instrumental commitments prove misleading that science should \nabandon standard tests and standard instruments? That would result in \nan inconceivable method of research. Paradigm procedures and \napplications are as necessary to science as paradigm laws and theories, \nand they have the same effects. Inevitably they restrict the phenom-\nenological field accessible for scientific investigation at any \n\n9 Conant, op. cit., pp. 18-20. \n10 K. K. Darrow, \u201cNuclear Fission,\u201d Bell System Technical Journal, XIX (1940), \n267-89. Krypton, one of the two main fission products, seems not to have been \nidentified by chemical means until after the reaction was well understood. \nBarium, the other product, was almost identified chemically at a late stage of the \ninvestigation because, as it happened, that element had to be added to the \nradioactive solution to precipitate the heavy element for which nuclear chemists \nwere looking. Failure to separate that added barium from the radioactive product \nfinally led, after the reaction had been repeatedly investigated for almost five \nyears, to the following report: \u201cAs chemists we should be led by this research . . . \nto change all the names in the preceding [reaction] schema and thus write Ba, La, \nCe instead of Ra, Ac, Th. But as \u2018nuclear chemists,\u2019 with close affiliations to \nphysics, we cannot bring ourselves to this leap which would contradict all pre-\nvious experience of nuclear physics. It may be that a series of strange accidents \nrenders our results deceptive\u201d (Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, \u201cUber den Nach-\nweis und das Verhalten der bei der Bestrahlung des Urans mittels Neutronen \nentstehended Erdalkalimetalle,\u201d Die Naturwissenschaften, XXVII [1939], 15). \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n60 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \ngiven time. Recognizing that much, we may simultaneously see an \nessential sense in which a discovery like X-rays necessitates paradigm \nchange\u2014and therefore change in both procedures and expectations\u2014for \na special segment of the scientific community. As a result, we may also \nunderstand how the discovery of X-rays could seem to open a strange \nnew world to many scientists and could thus participate so effectively in \nthe crisis that led to twentieth-century physics. \n\nOur final example of scientific discovery, that of the Leyden jar, \nbelongs to a class that may be described as theory-induced. Initially, the \nterm may seem paradoxical. Much that has been said so far suggests that \ndiscoveries predicted by theory in advance are parts of normal science \nand result in no new sort of fact. I have, for example, previously referred \nto the discoveries of new chemical elements during the second half of \nthe nineteenth century as proceeding from normal science in that way. \nBut not all theories are paradigm theories. Both during pre-paradigm \nperiods and during the crises that lead to large-scale changes of \nparadigm, scientists usually develop many speculative and unarticulated \ntheories that can themselves point the way to discovery. Often, however, \nthat discovery is not quite the one anticipated by the speculative and \ntentative hypothesis. Only as experiment and tentative theory are \ntogether articulated to a match does the discovery emerge and the \ntheory become a paradigm. \n\nThe discovery of the Leyden jar displays all these features as well as \nthe others we have observed before. When it began, there was no single \nparadigm for electrical research. Instead, a number of theories, all \nderived from relatively accessible phenomena, were in competition. \nNone of them succeeded in ordering the whole variety of electrical \nphenomena very well. That failure is the source of several of the \nanomalies that provide background for the discovery of the Leyden jar. \nOne of the competing schools of electricians took electricity to be a fluid, \nand that conception led a number of men to attempt bottling the fluid \nby holding a water-filled glass vial in their hands and touching the water \nto a conductor suspended from an active \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n61 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nelectrostatic generator. On removing the jar from the machine and \ntouching the water (or a conductor connected to it) with his free hand, \neach of these investigators experienced a severe shock. Those first \nexperiments did not, however, provide electricians with the Leyden jar. \nThat device emerged more slowly, and it is again impossible to say just \nwhen its discovery was completed. The initial attempts to store electrical \nfluid worked only because investigators held the vial in their hands \nwhile standing upon the ground. Electricians had still to learn that the \njar required an outer as well as an inner conducting coating and that the \nfluid is not really stored in the jar at all. Somewhere in the course of the \ninvestigations that showed them this, and which introduced them to \nseveral other anomalous effects, the device that we call the Leyden jar \nemerged. Furthermore, the experiments that led to its emergence, many \nof them performed by Franklin, were also the ones that necessitated the \ndrastic revision of the fluid theory and thus provided the first full \nparadigm for electricity.11 \n\nTo a greater or lesser extent (corresponding to the continuum from \nthe shocking to the anticipated result), the characteristics common to \nthe three examples above are characteristic of all discoveries from which \nnew sorts of phenomena emerge. Those characteristics include: the \nprevious awareness of anomaly, the gradual and simultaneous \nemergence of both observational and conceptual recognition, and the \nconsequent change of paradigm categories and procedures often \naccompanied by resistance. There is even evidence that these same \ncharacteristics are built into the nature of the perceptual process itself. \nIn a psychological experiment that deserves to be far better known \noutside the trade, Bruner and Postman asked experimental subjects to \nidentify on short and controlled exposure a series of playing cards. \nMany of the cards were normal, but some were made anoma- \n \n\n11 For various stages in the Leydun jar\u2019s evolution, see I.

The last stage is described by Whittaker, op. cit., pp. 50-52. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n62 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \nlous, e.g., a red six of spades and a black four of hearts. Each \nexperimental run was constituted by the display of a single card to a \nsingle subject in a series of gradually increased exposures. After each \nexposure the subject was asked what he had seen, and the run was \nterminated by two successive correct identifications.12 \n\nEven on the shortest exposures many subjects identified most of the \ncards, and after a small increase all the subjects identified them all. For \nthe normal cards these identifications were usually correct, but the \nanomalous cards were almost always identified, without apparent \nhesitation or puzzlement, as normal. The black four of hearts might, for \nexample, be identified as the four of either spades or hearts. Without \nany awareness of trouble, it was immediately fitted to one of the \nconceptual categories prepared by prior experience. One would not even \nlike to say that the subjects had seen something different from what \nthey identified. With a further increase of exposure to the anomalous \ncards, subjects did begin to hesitate and to display awareness of \nanomaly. Exposed, for example, to the red six of spades, some would say: \nThat\u2019s the six of spades, but there\u2019s something wrong with it\u2014the black \nhas a red border. Further increase of exposure resulted in still more \nhesitation and confusion until finally, and sometimes quite suddenly, \nmost subjects would produce the correct identification without \nhesitation. Moreover, after doing this with two or three of the \nanomalous cards, they would have little further difficulty with the \nothers. A few subjects, however, were never able to make the requisite \nadjustment of their categories. Even at forty times the average exposure \nrequired to recognize normal cards for what they were, more than 10 \nper cent of the anomalous cards were not correctly identified. And the \nsubjects who then failed often experienced acute personal distress. One \nof them exclaimed: \u201cI can\u2019t make the suit out, whatever it is. It didn\u2019t \neven look like a card that time. I don\u2019t know what color it is now or \nwhether it\u2019s a spade or a heart. I\u2019m \n \n\n12 J. S.

My God!\u201d13 In the next \nsection we shall occasionally see scientists behaving this way too. \n\nEither as a metaphor or because it reflects the nature of the mind, \nthat psychological experiment provides a wonderfully simple and cogent \nschema for the process of scientific discovery. In science, as in the \nplaying card experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty, \nmanifested by resistance, against a background provided by expectation. \nInitially, only the anticipated and usual are experienced even under \ncircumstances where anomaly is later to be observed. Further \nacquaintance, however, does result in awareness of something wrong or \ndoes relate the effect to something that has gone wrong before. That \nawareness of anomaly opens a period in which conceptual categories are \nadjusted until the initially anomalous has become the anticipated. At \nthis point the discovery has been completed. I have already urged that \nthat process or one very much like it is involved in the emergence of all \nfundamental scientific novelties. Let me now point out that, recognizing \nthe process, we can at last begin to see why normal science, a pursuit not \ndirected to novelties and tending at first to suppress them, should \nnevertheless be so effective in causing them to arise. \n\nIn the development of any science, the first received paradigm is \nusually felt to account quite successfully for most of the observations \nand experiments easily accessible to that science\u2019s practitioners. Further \ndevelopment, therefore, ordinarily calls for the construction of elaborate \nequipment, the development of an esoteric vocabulary and skills, and a \nrefinement of concepts that increasingly lessens their resemblance to \ntheir usual common-sense prototypes. That professionalization leads, on \nthe one hand, to an immense restriction of the scientist\u2019s vision and to a \nconsiderable resistance to paradigm change. The science has become \nincreasingly rigid. On the other hand, within those areas to which the \nparadigm directs the attention of the \n \n\n13 Ibid., p. 218. My colleague Postman tells me that, though knowing all about the \napparatus and display in advance, he nevertheless found looking at the \nincongruous cards acutely uncomfortable. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n64 \n\n\n\nAnomaly and the Emergence of Scientific Discoveries \n \ngroup, normal science leads to a detail of information and to a precision \nof the observation-theory match that could be achieved in no other way. \nFurthermore, that detail and precision-of-match have a value that \ntranscends their not always very high intrinsic interest. Without the \nspecial apparatus that is constructed mainly for anticipated functions, \nthe results that lead ultimately to novelty could not occur. And even \nwhen the apparatus exists, novelty ordinarily emerges only for the man \nwho, knowing with precision what he should expect, is able to recognize \nthat something has gone wrong. Anomaly appears only against the \nbackground provided by the paradigm. The more precise and far-\nreaching that paradigm is, the more sensitive an indicator it provides of \nanomaly and hence of an occasion for paradigm change. In the normal \nmode of discovery, even resistance to change has a use that will be \nexplored more fully in the next section. By ensuring that the paradigm \nwill not be too easily surrendered, resistance guarantees that scientists \nwill not be lightly distracted and that the anomalies that lead to \nparadigm change will penetrate existing knowledge to the core. The very \nfact that a significant scientific novelty so often emerges simultaneously \nfrom several laboratories is an index both to the strongly traditional \nnature of normal science and to the completeness with which that \ntraditional pursuit prepares the way for its own change. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n65 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVII. Crisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories \n\n \nAll the discoveries considered in Section VI were causes of or \n\ncontributors to paradigm change. Furthermore, the changes in which \nthese discoveries were implicated were all destructive as well as \nconstructive. After the discovery had been assimilated, scientists were \nable to account for a wider range of natural phenomena or to account \nwith greater precision for some of those previously known. But that gain \nwas achieved only by discarding some previously standard beliefs or \nprocedures and, simultaneously, by replacing those components of the \nprevious paradigm with others. Shifts of this sort are, I have argued, \nassociated with all discoveries achieved through normal science, \nexcepting only the unsurprising ones that had been anticipated in all but \ntheir details. Discoveries are not, however, the only sources of these \ndestructive-constructive paradigm changes. In this section we shall \nbegin to consider the similar, but usually far larger, shifts that result \nfrom the invention of new theories. \nHaving argued already that in the sciences fact and theory, discovery \nand invention, are not categorically and permanently distinct, we can \nanticipate overlap between this section and the last. (The impossible \nsuggestion that Priestley first discovered oxygen and Lavoisier then \ninvented it has its attractions. Oxygen has already been encountered as \ndiscovery; we shall shortly meet it again as invention.) In taking up the \nemergence of new theories we shall inevitably extend our \nunderstanding of discovery as well. Still, overlap is not identity. The \nsorts of discoveries considered in the last section were not, at least \nsingly, responsible for such paradigm shifts as the Copernican, \nNewtonian, chemical, and Einsteinian revolutions. Nor were they \nresponsible for the somewhat smaller, because more exclusively \nprofessional, changes in paradigm produced by the wave theory of light, \nthe dynamical theory of heat, or Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic theory. How \ncan theories like these arise from normal  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n66 \n\n\n\nCrisis and the Emergence of Scientific Theories \n \nscience, an activity even less directed to their pursuit than to that of \ndiscoveries? \n\nIf awareness of anomaly plays a role in the emergence of new sorts of \nphenomena, it should surprise no one that a similar but more profound \nawareness is prerequisite to all acceptable changes of theory. On this \npoint historical evidence is, I think, entirely unequivocal. The state of \nPtolemaic astronomy was a scandal before Copernicus\u2019 announcement.1 \nGalileo\u2019s contributions to the study of motion depended closely upon \ndifficulties discovered in Aristotle\u2019s theory by scholastic critics.2 \nNewton\u2019s new theory of light and color originated in the discovery that \nnone of the existing pre-paradigm theories would account for the length \nof the spectrum, and the wave theory that replaced Newton\u2019s was \nannounced in the midst of growing concern about anomalies in the \nrelation of diffraction and polarization effects to Newton\u2019s theory.3 \nThermodynamics was born from the collision of two existing \nnineteenth-century physical theories, and quantum mechanics from a \nvariety of difficulties surrounding black-body radiation, specific heats, \nand the photoelectric effect.4 Furthermore, in all these cases except that \nof Newton the awareness of anomaly had lasted so long and penetrated \nso deep that one can appropriately describe the fields affected by it as in \na state of growing crisis. Because it demands large-scale paradigm \ndestruction and major shifts in the problems and techniques of normal \nscience, the emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a period \nof pronounced professional in- \n\n1 A.

As one might expect, that insecurity is generated by the \npersistent failure of the puzzles of normal science to come out as they \nshould. Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones. \n\nLook first at a particularly famous case of paradigm change, the \nemergence of Copernican astronomy. When its predecessor, the \nPtolemaic system, was first developed during the last two centuries \nbefore Christ and the first two after, it was admirably successful in \npredicting the changing positions of both stars and planets. No other \nancient system had performed so well; for the stars, Ptolemaic \nastronomy is still widely used today as an engineering approximation; \nfor the planets, Ptolemy\u2019s predictions were as good as Copernicus\u2019. But \nto be admirably successful is never, for a scientific theory, to be \ncompletely successful. With respect both to planetary position and to \nprecession of the equinoxes, predictions made with Ptolemy\u2019s system \nnever quite conformed with the best available observations. Further \nreduction of those minor discrepancies constituted many of the \nprincipal problems of normal astronomical research for many of \nPtolemy\u2019s successors, just as a similar attempt to bring celestial \nobservation and Newtonian theory together provided normal research \nproblems for Newton\u2019s eighteenth-century successors. For some time \nastronomers had every reason to suppose that these attempts would be \nas successful as those that had led to Ptolemy\u2019s system. Given a \nparticular discrepancy, astronomers were invariably able to eliminate it \nby making some particular adjustment in Ptolemy\u2019s system of \ncompounded circles. But as time went on, a man looking at the net \nresult of the normal research effort of many astronomers could observe \nthat astronomy\u2019s complexity was increasing far more rapidly than its \naccuracy and that a discrepancy corrected in one place was likely to \nshow up in another.5 \n\nBecause the astronomical tradition was repeatedly interrupted from \noutside and because, in the absence of printing, communication \nbetween astronomers was restricted, these dif- \n \n\n5 J.

But awareness did come. By the \nthirteenth century Alfonso X could proclaim that if God had consulted \nhim when creating the universe, he would have received good advice. In \nthe sixteenth century, Copernicus\u2019 coworker, Domenico da Novara, held \nthat no system so cumbersome and inaccurate as the Ptolemaic had \nbecome could possibly be true of nature. And Copernicus himself wrote \nin the Preface to the De Revolutionibus that the astronomical tradition he \ninherited had finally created only a monster. By the early sixteenth \ncentury an increasing number of Europe\u2019s best astronomers were \nrecognizing that the astronomical paradigm was failing in application to \nits own traditional problems. That recognition was prerequisite to \nCopernicus\u2019 rejection of the Ptolemaic paradigm and his search for a \nnew one. His famous preface still provides one of the classic descriptions \nof a crisis state.6 \n\nBreakdown of the normal technical puzzle-solving activity is not, of \ncourse, the only ingredient of the astronomical crisis that faced \nCopernicus. An extended treatment would also discuss the social \npressure for calendar reform, a pressure that made the puzzle of \nprecession particularly urgent. In addition, a fuller account would \nconsider medieval criticism of Aristotle, the rise of Renaissance \nNeoplatonism, and other significant historical elements besides. But \ntechnical breakdown would still remain the core of the crisis. In a \nmature science\u2014and astronomy had become that in antiquity\u2014external \nfactors like those cited above are principally significant in determining \nthe timing of breakdown, the ease with which it can be recognized, and \nthe area in which, because it is given particular attention, the \nbreakdown first occurs. Though immensely important, issues of that sort \nare out of bounds for this essay. \n\nIf that much is clear in the case of the Copernican revolution, let us \nturn from it to a second and rather different example, the crisis that \npreceded the emergence of Lavoisier\u2019s oxygen theory of combustion. In \nthe 1770\u2019s many factors combined to generate \n \n\n6  T. S.

But two of them are \ngenerally accepted as of first-rate significance: the rise of pneumatic \nchemistry and the question of weight relations. The history of the first \nbegins in the seventeenth century with development of the air pump \nand its deployment in chemical experimentation. During the following \ncentury, using that pump and a number of other pneumatic devices, \nchemists came increasingly to realize that air must be an active \ningredient in chemical reactions. But with a few exceptions\u2014so \nequivocal that they may not be exceptions at all\u2014chemists continued to \nbelieve that air was the only sort of gas. Until 1756, when Joseph Black \nshowed that fixed air (CO2) was consistently distinguishable from \nnormal air, two samples of gas were thought to be distinct only in their \nimpurities.7 \n\nAfter Black\u2019s work the investigation of gases proceeded rapidly, most \nnotably in the hands of Cavendish, Priestley, and Scheele, who together \ndeveloped a number of new techniques capable of distinguishing one \nsample of gas from another. All these men, from Black through Scheele, \nbelieved in the phlogiston theory and often employed it in their design \nand interpretation of experiments. Scheele actually first produced \noxygen by an elaborate chain of experiments designed to dephlogisticate \nheat. Yet the net result of their experiments was a variety of gas samples \nand gas properties so elaborate that the phlogiston theory proved \nincreasingly little able to cope with laboratory experience. Though none \nof these chemists suggested that the theory should be replaced, they \nwere unable to apply it consistently. By the time Lavoisier began his \nexperiments on airs in the early 1770\u2019s, there were almost as many \nversions of the phlogiston theory as there were pneumatic chemists.8 \nThat \n \n\n7 J. R.

In \nhis preface, Copernicus complained of it as well. \n\nThe increasing vagueness and decreasing utility of the phlogiston \ntheory for pneumatic chemistry were not, however, the only source of \nthe crisis that confronted Lavoisier. He was also much concerned to \nexplain the gain in weight that most bodies experience when burned or \nroasted, and that again is a problem with a long prehistory. At least a few \nIslamic chemists had known that some metals gain weight when roasted. \nIn the seventeenth century several investigators had concluded from \nthis same fact that a roasted metal takes up some ingredient from the \natmosphere. But in the seventeenth century that conclusion seemed \nunnecessary to most chemists. If chemical reactions could alter the \nvolume, color, and texture of the ingredients, why should they not alter \nweight as well? Weight was not always taken to be the measure of \nquantity of matter. Besides, weight-gain on roasting remained an \nisolated phenomenon. Most natural bodies (e.g., wood) lose weight on \nroasting as the phlogiston theory was later to say they should. \n\nDuring the eighteenth century, however, these initially adequate \nresponses to the problem of weight-gain became increasingly difficult to \nmaintain. Partly because the balance was increasingly used as a \nstandard chemical tool and partly because the development of \npneumatic chemistry made it possible and desirable to retain the \ngaseous products of reactions, chemists discovered more and more cases \nin which weight-gain accompanied roasting. Simultaneously, the gradual \nassimilation of Newton\u2019s gravitational theory led chemists to insist that \ngain in weight must mean gain in quantity of matter. Those conclusions \ndid not result in rejection of the phlogiston theory, for that theory could \nbe adjusted in many ways. Perhaps phlogiston had negative weight, or \nperhaps fire particles or something else entered the roasted body as \nphlogiston left it. There were other explanations besides. But if the \nproblem of weight-gain did not lead to rejection, it did lead to an \nincreasing number of special studies in which this problem bulked large. \nOne of them, \u201cOn \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n71 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nphlogiston considered as a substance with weight and [analyzed] in \nterms of the weight changes it produces in bodies with which it unites,\u201d \nwas read to the French Academy early in 1772, the year which closed \nwith Lavoisier\u2019s delivery of his famous sealed note to the Academy\u2019s \nSecretary. Before that note was written a problem that had been at the \nedge of the chemist\u2019s consciousness for many years had become an \noutstanding unsolved puzzle.9 Many different versions of the phlogiston \ntheory were being elaborated to meet it. Like the problems of pneumatic \nchemistry, those of weight-gain were making it harder and harder to \nknow what the phlogiston theory was. Though still believed and trusted \nas a working tool, a paradigm of eighteenth-century chemistry was \ngradually losing its unique status. Increasingly, the research it guided \nresembled that conducted under the competing schools of the pre-\nparadigm period, another typical effect of crisis. \n\nConsider now, as a third and final example, the late nineteenth \ncentury crisis in physics that prepared the way for the emergence of \nrelativity theory. One root of that crisis can be traced to the late \nseventeenth century when a number of natural philosophers, most \nnotably Leibniz, criticized Newton\u2019s retention of an updated version of \nthe classic conception of absolute space.10 They were very nearly, \nthough never quite, able to show that absolute positions and absolute \nmotions were without any function at all in Newton\u2019s system; and they \ndid succeed in hinting at the considerable aesthetic appeal a fully \nrelativistic conception of space and motion would later come to display. \nBut their critique was purely logical. Like the early Copernicans who \ncriticized Aristotle\u2019s proofs of the earth\u2019s stability, they did not dream \nthat transition to a relativistic system could have observational \nconsequences. At no point did they relate their views to any problems \nthat arose when applying Newtonian theory to nature. As a result, their \nviews died with \n \n\n9 H.

If light is wave motion propagated in a \nmechanical ether governed by Newton\u2019s Laws, then both celestial \nobservation and terrestrial experiment become potentially capable of \ndetecting drift through the ether. Of the celestial observations, only \nthose of aberration promised sufficient accuracy to provide relevant \ninformation, and the detection of ether-drift by aberration \nmeasurements therefore became a recognized problem for normal \nresearch. Much special equipment was built to resolve it. That \nequipment, however, detected no observable drift, and the problem was \ntherefore transferred from the experimentalists and observers to the \ntheoreticians. During the central decades of the century Fresnel, Stokes, \nand others devised numerous articulations of the ether theory designed \nto explain the failure to observe drift. Each of these articulations \nassumed that a moving body drags some fraction of the ether with it. \nAnd each was sufficiently successful to explain the negative results not \nonly of celestial observation but also of terrestrial experimentation, \nincluding the famous experiment of Michelson and Morley.11 There was \nstill no conflict excepting that between the various articulations. In the \nabsence of relevant experimental techniques, that conflict never became \nacute. \n\nThe situation changed again only with the gradual acceptance of \nMaxwell\u2019s electromagnetic theory in the last two decades of the \nnineteenth century. Maxwell himself was a Newtonian who believed \nthat light and electromagnetism in general were due to variable \ndisplacements of the particles of a mechanical ether. His earliest \nversions of a theory for electricity and \n \n\n11 Joseph Larmor, Aether and Matter . . .

These were dropped from his final version, but \nhe still believed his electromagnetic theory compatible with some \narticulation of the Newtonian mechanical view.12 Developing a suitable \narticulation was a challenge for him and his successors. In practice, \nhowever, as has happened again and again in scientific development, the \nrequired articulation proved immensely difficult to produce. Just as \nCopernicus\u2019 astronomical proposal, despite the optimism of its author, \ncreated an increasing crisis for existing theories of motion, so Maxwell\u2019s \ntheory, despite its Newtonian origin, ultimately produced a crisis for the \nparadigm from which it had sprung.13 Furthermore, the locus at which \nthat crisis became most acute was provided by the problems we have \njust been considering, those of motion with respect to the ether. \n\nMaxwell\u2019s discussion of the electromagnetic behavior of bodies in \nmotion had made no reference to ether drag, and it proved very difficult \nto introduce such drag into his theory. As a result, a whole series of \nearlier observations designed to detect drift through the ether became \nanomalous. The years after 1890 therefore witnessed a long series of \nattempts, both experimental and theoretical, to detect motion with \nrespect to the ether and to work ether drag into Maxwell\u2019s theory. The \nformer were uniformly unsuccessful, though some analysts thought \ntheir results equivocal. The latter produced a number of promising \nstarts, particularly those of Lorentz and Fitzgerald, but they also \ndisclosed still other puzzles and finally resulted in just that proliferation \nof competing theories that we have previously found to be the \nconcomitant of crisis.14 It is against that historical setting that Einstein\u2019s \nspecial theory of relativity emerged in 1905. \n\nThese three examples are almost entirely typical. In each case a novel \ntheory emerged only after a pronounced failure in the \n \n\n12 R. T. Glazebrook, James Clerk Maxwell and Modern Physics (London, 1896), \nchap. ix.

Furthermore, except for the case of \nCopernicus in which factors external to science played a particularly \nlarge role, that breakdown and the proliferation of theories that is its \nsign occurred no more than a decade or two before the new theory\u2019s \nenunciation. The novel theory seems a direct response to crisis. Note \nalso, though this may not be quite so typical, that the problems with \nrespect to which breakdown occurred were all of a type that had long \nbeen recognized. Previous practice of normal science had given every \nreason to consider them solved or all but solved, which helps to explain \nwhy the sense of failure, when it came, could be so acute. Failure with a \nnew sort of problem is often disappointing but never surprising. Neither \nproblems nor puzzles yield often to the first attack. Finally, these \nexamples share another characteristic that may help to make the case \nfor the role of crisis impressive: the solution to each of them had been at \nleast partially anticipated during a period when there was no crisis in \nthe corresponding science; and in the absence of crisis those \nanticipations had been ignored. \n\nThe only complete anticipation is also the most famous, that of \nCopernicus by Aristarchus in the third century B.C It is often said that if \nGreek science had been less deductive and less ridden by dogma, \nheliocentric astronomy might have begun its development eighteen \ncenturies earlier than it did.15 But that is to ignore all historical context. \nWhen Aristarchus\u2019 suggestion was made, the vastly more reasonable \ngeocentric system had no needs that a heliocentric system might even \nconceivably have fulfilled. The whole development of Ptolemaic \nastronomy, both its triumphs and its breakdown, falls in the centuries \nafter Aristarchus\u2019 proposal. Besides, there were no obvious reasons for \ntaking Aristarchus seriously. Even Copernicus\u2019 more elaborate proposal \nwas neither simpler nor more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s system. Available \nobservational tests, as we shall see more clear- \n \n\n15 For Aristarchus\u2019 work, see T. L. Heath, Aristarchus of Samos: The Ancient \nCopernicus (Oxford, 1913), Part II. For an extreme statement of the traditional \nposition about the neglect of Aristarchus\u2019 achievement, see Arthur Koestler, The \nSleepwalkers: A History of Man\u2019s Changing Vision of the Universe (London, 1959), \np. 50. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n75 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nly below, provided no basis for a choice between them. Under those \ncircumstances, one of the factors that led astronomers to Copernicus \n(and one that could not have led them to Aristarchus) was the \nrecognized crisis that had been responsible for innovation in the first \nplace. Ptolemaic astronomy had failed to solve its problems; the time \nhad come to give a competitor a chance. Our other two examples \nprovide no similarly full anticipations. But surely one reason why the \ntheories of combustion by absorption from the atmosphere\u2014theories \ndeveloped in the seventeenth century by Rey, Hooke, and Mayow\u2014failed \nto get a sufficient hearing was that they made no contact with a \nrecognized trouble spot in normal scientific practice.16 And the long \nneglect by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scientists of Newton\u2019s \nrelativistic critics must largely have been due to a similar failure in \nconfrontation. \n\nPhilosophers of science have repeatedly demonstrated that more than \none theoretical construction can always be placed upon a given \ncollection of data. History of science indicates that, particularly in the \nearly developmental stages of a new paradigm, it is not even very \ndifficult to invent such alternates. But that invention of alternates is just \nwhat scientists seldom undertake except during the pre-paradigm stage \nof their science\u2019s development and at very special occasions during its \nsubsequent evolution. So long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue \nto prove capable of solving the problems it defines, science moves fastest \nand penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those \ntools. The reason is clear. As in manufacture so in science\u2014retooling is \nan extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it. The \nsignificance of crises is the indication they provide that an occasion for \nretooling has arrived. \n \n\n16 Partington, op. cit., pp. 78-85. \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n76 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \nVIII. The Response to Crisis \n\n \nLet us then assume that crises are a necessary precondition for the \n\nemergence of novel theories and ask next how scientists respond to their \nexistence. Part of the answer, as obvious as it is important, can be \ndiscovered by noting first what scientists never do when confronted by \neven severe and prolonged anomalies. Though they may begin to lose \nfaith and then to consider alternatives, they do not renounce the \nparadigm that has led them into crisis. They do not, that is, treat \nanomalies as counter-instances, though in the vocabulary of philosophy \nof science that is what they are. In part this generalization is simply a \nstatement from historic fact, based upon examples like those given \nabove and, more extensively, below. These hint what our later \nexamination of paradigm rejection will disclose more fully: once it has \nachieved the status of paradigm, a scientific theory is declared invalid \nonly if an alternate candidate is available to take its place. No process yet \ndisclosed by the historical study of scientific development at all \nresembles the methodological stereotype of falsification by direct \ncomparison with nature. That remark does not mean that scientists do \nnot reject scientific theories, or that experience and experiment are not \nessential to the process in which they do so. But it does mean\u2014what will \nultimately be a central point\u2014that the act of judgment that leads \nscientists to reject a previously accepted theory is always based upon \nmore than a comparison of that theory with the world. The decision to \nreject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept \nanother, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the \ncomparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other. \n\nThere is, in addition, a second reason for doubting that scientists \nreject paradigms because confronted with anomalies or \ncounterinstances. In developing it my argument will itself foreshadow \nanother of this essay\u2019s main theses. The reasons for doubt sketched \nabove were purely factual; they were, that is, \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n77 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nthemselves counterinstances to a prevalent epistemological theory. As \nsuch, if my present point is correct, they can at best help to create a \ncrisis or, more accurately, to reinforce one that is already very much in \nexistence. By themselves they cannot and will not falsify that \nphilosophical theory, for its defenders will do what we have already seen \nscientists doing when confronted by anomaly. They will devise \nnumerous articulations and ad hoc modifications of their theory in order \nto eliminate any apparent conflict. Many of the relevant modifications \nand qualifications are, in fact, already in the literature. If, therefore, \nthese epistemological counterinstances are to constitute more than a \nminor irritant, that will be because they help to permit the emergence \nof a new and different analysis of science within which they are no \nlonger a source of trouble. Furthermore, if a typical pattern, which we \nshall later observe in scientific revolutions, is applicable here, these \nanomalies will then no longer seem to be simply facts. From within a \nnew theory of scientific knowledge, they may instead seem very much \nlike tautologies, statements of situations that could not conceivably have \nbeen otherwise. \n\nIt has often been observed, for example, that Newton\u2019s second law of \nmotion, though it took centuries of difficult factual and theoretical \nresearch to achieve, behaves for those committed to Newton\u2019s theory \nvery much like a purely logical statement that no amount of observation \ncould refute.1 In Section X we shall see that the chemical law of fixed \nproportion, which before Dalton was an occasional experimental finding \nof very dubious generality, became after Dalton\u2019s work an ingredient of \na definition of chemical compound that no experimental work could by \nitself have upset. Something much like that will also happen to the \ngeneralization that scientists fail to reject paradigms when faced with \nanomalies or counterinstances. They could not do so and still remain \nscientists. \n\nThough history is unlikely to record their names, some men have \nundoubtedly been driven to desert science because of \n \n\n1 See particularly the discussion in N. R. Hanson, Patterns of Discovery \n(Cambridge, 1958), pp. 99-105. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n78 \n\n\n\nThe Response to Crisis \n \ntheir inability to tolerate crisis. Like artists, creative scientists must \noccasionally be able to live in a world out of joint\u2014elsewhere I have \ndescribed that necessity as \u201cthe essential tension\u201d implicit in scientific \nresearch.2 But that rejection of science in favor of another occupation is, \nI think, the only sort of paradigm rejection to which counterinstances by \nthemselves can lead. Once a first paradigm through which to view \nnature has been found, there is no such thing as research in the absence \nof any paradigm. To reject one paradigm without simultaneously \nsubstituting another is to reject science itself. That act reflects not on the \nparadigm but on the man. Inevitably he will be seen by his colleagues as \n\u201cthe carpenter who blames his tools.\u201d \n\nThe same point can be made at least equally effectively in reverse: \nthere is no such thing as research without counter-instances. For what is \nit that differentiates normal science from science in a crisis state? Not, \nsurely, that the former confronts no counterinstances. On the contrary, \nwhat we previously called the puzzles that constitute normal science \nexist only because no paradigm that provides a basis for scientific \nresearch ever completely resolves all its problems. The very few that \nhave ever seemed to do so (e.g., geometric optics) have shortly ceased to \nyield research problems at all and have instead become tools for \nengineering. Excepting those that are exclusively instrumental, every \nproblem that normal science sees as a puzzle can be seen, from another \nviewpoint, as a counterinstance and thus as a source of crisis. \nCopernicus saw as counterinstances what most of Ptolemy\u2019s other \nsuccessors had seen as puzzles in the match between observation and \ntheory. Lavoisier saw as a counterinstance what Priestley had seen as a \nsuccessfully solved puzzle in the articulation of the phlogiston theory. \nAnd Einstein saw as counterinstances what Lorentz, Fitzgerald, and \nothers had seen as puzzles in the articulation of Newton\u2019s and Max- \n \n\n2 T.

Furthermore, even the existence of crisis does not by \nitself transform a puzzle into a counterinstance. There is no such sharp \ndividing line. Instead, by proliferating versions of the paradigm, crisis \nloosens the rules of normal puzzle-solving in ways that ultimately \npermit a new paradigm to emerge. There are, I think, only two \nalternatives: either no scientific theory ever confronts a counterinstance, \nor all such theories confront counterinstances at all times. \n\nHow can the situation have seemed otherwise? That question \nnecessarily leads to the historical and critical elucidation of philosophy, \nand those topics are here barred. But we can at least note two reasons \nwhy science has seemed to provide so apt an illustration of the \ngeneralization that truth and falsity are uniquely and unequivocally \ndetermined by the confrontation of statement with fact. Normal science \ndoes and must continually strive to bring theory and fact into closer \nagreement, and that activity can easily be seen as testing or as a search \nfor confirmation or falsification. Instead, its object is to solve a puzzle for \nwhose very existence the validity of the paradigm must be assumed. \nFailure to achieve a solution discredits only the scientist and not the \ntheory. Here, even more than above, the proverb applies: \u201cIt is a poor \ncarpenter who blames his tools.\u201d In addition, the manner in which \nscience pedagogy entangles discussion of a theory with remarks on its \nexemplary applications has helped to reinforce a confirmation-theory \ndrawn predominantly from other sources. Given the slightest reason for \ndoing so, the man who reads a science text can easily take the \napplications to be the evidence for the theory, the reasons why it ought \nto be believed. But science students accept theories on the authority of \nteacher and text, not because of evidence. What alternatives have they, \nor what competence? The applications given in texts are not there as \nevidence but because learning them is part of learning the paradigm at \nthe base of current practice. If applications were set forth as evidence, \nthen the very failure of texts to suggest alternative interpretations or to \ndiscuss problems for which scientists have failed to produce paradigm \nsolutions  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n80 \n\n\n\nThe Response to Crisis \n \nwould convict their authors of extreme bias. There is not the slightest \nreason for such an indictment. \n\nHow, then, to return to the initial question, do scientists respond to \nthe awareness of an anomaly in the fit between theory and nature? \nWhat has just been said indicates that even a discrepancy \nunaccountably larger than that experienced in other applications of the \ntheory need not draw any very profound response. There are always \nsome discrepancies. Even the most stubborn ones usually respond at last \nto normal practice. Very often scientists are willing to wait, particularly \nif there are many problems available in other parts of the field. We have \nalready noted, for example, that during the sixty years after Newton\u2019s \noriginal computation, the predicted motion of the moon\u2019s perigee \nremained only half of that observed. As Europe\u2019s best mathematical \nphysicists continued to wrestle unsuccessfully with the well-known \ndiscrepancy, there were occasional proposals for a modification of \nNewton\u2019s inverse square law. But no one took these proposals very \nseriously, and in practice this patience with a major anomaly proved \njustified. Clairaut in 1750 was able to show that only the mathematics of \nthe application had been wrong and that Newtonian theory could stand \nas before.3 Even in cases where no mere mistake seems quite possible \n(perhaps because the mathematics involved is simpler or of a familiar \nand elsewhere successful sort), persistent and recognized anomaly does \nnot always induce crisis. No one seriously questioned Newtonian theory \nbecause of the long-recognized discrepancies between predictions from \nthat theory and both the speed of sound and the motion of Mercury. \nThe first discrepancy was ultimately and quite unexpectedly resolved by \nexperiments on heat undertaken for a very different purpose; the \nsecond vanished with the general theory of relativity after a crisis that it \nhad had no role in creating.4 Apparent- \n\n \n3 W. Whewell, History of the Inductive Sciences (rev. ed.; London, 1847), II, 220-\n21. \n4 For the speed of sound, see T. S.

Whittaker, A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, II \n(London, 1953), 151, 179. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n81 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nly neither had seemed sufficiently fundamental to evoke the malaise \nthat goes with crisis. They could be recognized as counterinstances and \nstill be set aside for later work. \n\nIt follows that if an anomaly is to evoke crisis, it must usually be more \nthan just an anomaly. There are always difficulties somewhere in the \nparadigm-nature fit; most of them are set right sooner or later, often by \nprocesses that could not have been foreseen. The scientist who pauses to \nexamine every anomaly he notes will seldom get significant work done. \nWe therefore have to ask what it is that makes an anomaly seem worth \nconcerted scrutiny, and to that question there is probably no fully \ngeneral answer. The cases we have already examined are characteristic \nbut scarcely prescriptive. Sometimes an anomaly will clearly call into \nquestion explicit and fundamental generalizations of the paradigm, as \nthe problem of ether drag did for those who accepted Maxwell\u2019s theory. \nOr, as in the Copernican revolution, an anomaly without apparent \nfundamental import may evoke crisis if the applications that it inhibits \nhave a particular practical importance, in this case for calendar design \nand astrology. Or, as in eighteenth-century chemistry, the development \nof normal science may transform an anomaly that had previously been \nonly a vexation into a source of crisis: the problem of weight relations \nhad a very different status after the evolution of pneumatic-chemical \ntechniques. Presumably there are still other circumstances that can \nmake an anomaly particularly pressing, and ordinarily several of these \nwill combine. We have already noted, for example, that one source of \nthe crisis that confronted Copernicus was the mere length of time \nduring which astronomers had wrestled unsuccessfully with the \nreduction of the residual discrepancies in Ptolemy\u2019s system. \nWhen, for these reasons or others like them, an anomaly comes to seem \nmore than just another puzzle of normal science, the transition to crisis \nand to extraordinary science has begun. The anomaly itself now comes \nto be more generally recognized as such by the profession. More and \nmore attention is devoted to it by more and more of the field\u2019s most \neminent men. If it still continues to resist, as it usually does not, many of \nthem may  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n82 \n\n\n\nThe Response to Crisis \n \ncome to view its resolution as the subject matter of their discipline. For \nthem the field will no longer look quite the same as it had earlier. Part of \nits different appearance results simply from the new fixation point of \nscientific scrutiny. An even more important source of change is the \ndivergent nature of the numerous partial solutions that concerted \nattention to the problem has made available. The early attacks upon the \nresistant problem will have followed the paradigm rules quite closely. \nBut with continuing resistance, more and more of the attacks upon it \nwill have involved some minor or not so minor articulation of the \nparadigm, no two of them quite alike, each partially successful, but none \nsufficiently so to be accepted as paradigm by the group. Through this \nproliferation of divergent articulations (more and more frequently they \nwill come to be described as ad hoc adjustments), the rules of normal \nscience become increasingly blurred. Though there still is a paradigm, \nfew practitioners prove to be entirely agreed about what it is. Even \nformerly standard solutions of solved problems are called in question. \n\nWhen acute, this situation is sometimes recognized by the scientists \ninvolved. Copernicus complained that in his day astronomers were so \n\u201cinconsistent in these [astronomical] investigations . . . that they cannot \neven explain or observe the constant length of the seasonal year.\u201d \u201cWith \nthem,\u201d he continued, \u201cit is as though an artist were to gather the hands, \nfeet, head and other members for his images from diverse models, each \npart excellently drawn, but not related to a single body, and since they \nin no way match each other, the result would be monster rather than \nman.\u201d5 Einstein, restricted by current usage to less florid language, \nwrote only, \u201cIt was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, \nwith no firm foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could \nhave built.\u201d6 And Wolfgang Pauli, in the months before Heisenberg\u2019s \npaper on matrix \n\n \n5 Quoted in T.

To be sure it does not supply the solution to the riddle, \nbut I believe it is again possible to march forward.\u201d7 \n\nSuch explicit recognitions of breakdown are extremely rare, but the \neffects of crisis do not entirely depend upon its conscious recognition. \nWhat can we say these effects are? Only two of them seem to be \nuniversal. All crises begin with the blurring of a paradigm and the \nconsequent loosening of the rules for normal research. In this respect \nresearch during crisis very much resembles research during the pre-\nparadigm period, except that in the former the locus of difference is \nboth smaller and more clearly defined. And all crises close in one of \nthree ways. Sometimes normal science ultimately proves able to handle \nthe crisis-provoking problem despite the despair of those who have seen \nit as the end of an existing paradigm. On other occasions the problem \nresists even apparently radical new approaches. Then scientists may \nconclude that no solution will be forthcoming in the present state of \ntheir field. The problem is labelled and set aside for a future generation \nwith more developed tools. Or, finally, the case that will most concern us \nhere, a crisis may end with the emergence of a new candidate for \nparadigm and with the ensuing battle over its acceptance. This last \nmode of closure will be considered at length in later sections, but we \nmust anticipate a bit of what will be said there in order to complete \nthese remarks about the evolution and anatomy of the crisis state. \n\nThe transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a \nnew tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative \nprocess, one achieved by an articulation or exten- \n \n7 Ralph Kronig, \u201cThe Turning Point,\u201d in Theoretical Physics in the Twentieth \nCentury: A Memorial Volume to Wolfgang Pauli, ed.

Rather it is a reconstruction of the field from \nnew fundamentals, a reconstruction that changes some of the field\u2019s \nmost elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its \nparadigm methods and applications. During the transition period there \nwill be a large but never complete overlap between the problems that \ncan be solved by the old and by the new paradigm. But there will also be \na decisive difference in the modes of solution. When the transition is \ncomplete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its \nmethods, and its goals. One perceptive historian, viewing a classic case \nof a science\u2019s reorientation by paradigm change, recently described it as \n\u201cpicking up the other end of the stick,\u201d a process that involves \u201chandling \nthe same bundle of data as before, but placing them in a new system of \nrelations with one another by giving them a different framework.\u201d8 \nOthers who have noted this aspect of scientific advance have \nemphasized its similarity to a change in visual gestalt: the marks on \npaper that were first seen as a bird are now seen as an antelope, or vice \nversa.9 That parallel can be misleading. Scientists do not see something \nas something else; instead, they simply see it. We have already examined \nsome of the problems created by saying that Priestley saw oxygen as \ndephlogisticated air. In addition, the scientist does not preserve the \ngestalt subject\u2019s freedom to switch back and forth between ways of \nseeing. Nevertheless, the switch of gestalt, particularly because it is \ntoday so familiar, is a useful elementary prototype for what occurs in \nfull-scale paradigm shift. \n\nThe preceding anticipation may help us recognize crisis as an \nappropriate prelude to the emergence of new theories, particularly since \nwe have already examined a small-scale version of the same process in \ndiscussing the emergence of discoveries. Just because the emergence of \na new theory breaks with one tradition of scientific practice and \nintroduces a new one conducted under different rules and within a \ndifferent universe of \n \n\n8 Herbert Butterfield, The Origins of Modern Science, 1300-1800 (London, 1949), \npp. 1-7. \n9 Hanson, op. cit., chap. i. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n85 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ndiscourse, it is likely to occur only when the first tradition is felt to have \ngone badly astray. That remark is, however, no more than a prelude to \nthe investigation of the crisis-state, and, unfortunately, the questions to \nwhich it leads demand the competence of the psychologist even more \nthan that of the historian. What is extraordinary research like? How is \nanomaly made lawlike? How do scientists proceed when aware only that \nsomething has gone fundamentally wrong at a level with which their \ntraining has not equipped them to deal? Those questions need far more \ninvestigation, and it ought not all be historical. What follows will \nnecessarily be more tentative and less complete than what has gone \nbefore. \n\nOften a new paradigm emerges, at least in embryo, before a crisis has \ndeveloped far or been explicitly recognized. Lavoisier\u2019s work provides a \ncase in point. His sealed note was deposited with the French Academy \nless than a year after the first thorough study of weight relations in the \nphlogiston theory and before Priestley\u2019s publications had revealed the \nfull extent of the crisis in pneumatic chemistry. Or again, Thomas \nYoung\u2019s first accounts of the wave theory of light appeared at a very \nearly stage of a developing crisis in optics, one that would be almost \nunnoticeable except that, with no assistance from Young, it had grown to \nan international scientific scandal within a decade of the time he first \nwrote. In cases like these one can say only that a minor breakdown of \nthe paradigm and the very first blurring of its rules for normal science \nwere sufficient to induce in someone a new way of looking at the field. \nWhat intervened between the first sense of trouble and the recognition \nof an available alternate must have been largely unconscious. \nIn other cases, however\u2014those of Copernicus, Einstein, and \ncontemporary nuclear theory, for example\u2014considerable time elapses \nbetween the first consciousness of breakdown and the emergence of a \nnew paradigm. When that occurs, the historian may capture at least a \nfew hints of what extraordinary science is like. Faced with an admittedly \nfundamental anomaly in theory, the scientist\u2019s first effort will often be \nto isolate it more precisely and to give it structure. Though now aware \nthat they  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n86 \n\n\n\nThe Response to Crisis \n \ncannot be quite right, he will push the rules of normal science harder \nthan ever to see, in the area of difficulty, just where and how far they \ncan be made to work. Simultaneously he will seek for ways of \nmagnifying the breakdown, of making it more striking and perhaps also \nmore suggestive than it had been when displayed in experiments the \noutcome of which was thought to be known in advance. And in the \nlatter effort, more than in any other part of the post-paradigm \ndevelopment of science, he will look almost like our most prevalent \nimage of the scientist. He will, in the first place, often seem a man \nsearching at random, trying experiments just to see what will happen, \nlooking for an effect whose nature he cannot quite guess. \nSimultaneously, since no experiment can be conceived without some \nsort of theory, the scientist in crisis will constantly try to generate \nspeculative theories that, if successful, may disclose the road to a new \nparadigm and, if unsuccessful, can be surrendered with relative ease. \n\nKepler\u2019s account of his prolonged struggle with the motion of Mars \nand Priestley\u2019s description of his response to the proliferation of new \ngases provide classic examples of the more random sort of research \nproduced by the awareness of anomaly.10 But probably the best \nillustrations of all come from contemporary research in field theory and \non fundamental particles. In the absence of a crisis that made it \nnecessary to see just how far the rules of normal science could stretch, \nwould the immense effort required to detect the neutrino have seemed \njustified? Or, if the rules had not obviously broken down at some \nundisclosed point, would the radical hypothesis of parity non-\nconservation have been either suggested or tested? Like much other \nresearch in physics during the past decade, these experiments were in \npart attempts to localize and define the source of a still diffuse set of \nanomalies. \n\nThis sort of extraordinary research is often, though by no \n \n\n10 For an account of Kepler\u2019s work on Mars, see J. L. E. Dreyer, A History of \nAstronomy from Thales to Kepler (2d ed.; New York, 1953), pp. 380-93. Occasional \ninaccuracies do not prevent Dreyer\u2019s pr\u00e9cis from providing the material needed \nhere. For Priestley, see his own work, esp.

It is, I think, particularly in \nperiods of acknowledged crisis that scientists have turned to \nphilosophical analysis as a device for unlocking the riddles of their field. \nScientists have not generally needed or wanted to be philosophers. \nIndeed, normal science usually holds creative philosophy at arm\u2019s \nlength, and probably for good reasons. To the extent that normal \nresearch work can be conducted by using the paradigm as a model, rules \nand assumptions need not be made explicit. In Section V we noted that \nthe full set of rules sought by philosophical analysis need not even exist. \nBut that is not to say that the search for assumptions (even for non-\nexistent ones) cannot be an effective way to weaken the grip of a \ntradition upon the mind and to suggest the basis for a new one. It is no \naccident that the emergence of Newtonian physics in the seventeenth \ncentury and of relativity and quantum mechanics in the twentieth \nshould have been both preceded and accompanied by fundamental \nphilosophical analyses of the contemporary research tradition.11 Nor is it \nan accident that in both these periods the so-called thought experiment \nshould have played so critical a role in the progress of research. As I \nhave shown elsewhere, the analytical thought experimentation that \nbulks so large in the writings of Galileo, Einstein, Bohr, and others is \nperfectly calculated to expose the old paradigm to existing knowledge in \nways that isolate the root of crisis with a clarity unattainable in the \nlaboratory.12 \n\nWith the deployment, singly or together, of these extraordinary \nprocedures, one other thing may occur. By concentrating scientific \nattention upon a narrow area of trouble and by preparing the scientific \nmind to recognize experimental anomalies for what they are, crisis often \nproliferates new discoveries. We have already noted how the awareness \nof crisis distinguishes \n\n \n11 For the philosophical counterpoint that accompanied seventeenth-century \nmechanics, see Ren\u00e9 Dugas, La m\u00e9canique au XVIIe si\u00e8cle (Neuchatel, 1954), \nparticularly chap. xi.

Or again, new optical discoveries accumulated \nrapidly just before and during the emergence of the wave theory of light. \nSome, like polarization by reflection, were a result of the accidents that \nconcentrated work in an area of trouble makes likely. (Malus, who made \nthe discovery, was just starting work for the Academy\u2019s prize essay on \ndouble refraction, a subject widely known to be in an unsatisfactory \nstate.) Others, like the light spot at the center of the shadow of a circular \ndisk, were predictions from the new hypothesis, ones whose success \nhelped to transform it to a paradigm for later work. And still others, like \nthe colors of scratches and of thick plates, were effects that had often \nbeen seen and occasionally remarked before, but that, like Priestley\u2019s \noxygen, had been assimilated to well-known effects in ways that \nprevented their being seen for what they were.13 A similar account could \nbe given of the multiple discoveries that, from about 1895, were a \nconstant concomitant of the emergence of quantum mechanics. \nExtraordinary research must have still other manifestations and effects, \nbut in this area we have scarcely begun to discover the questions that \nneed to be asked. Perhaps, however, no more are needed at this point. \nThe preceding remarks should suffice to show how crisis simultaneously \nloosens the stereotypes and provides the incremental data necessary for \na fundamental paradigm shift. Sometimes the shape of the new \nparadigm is foreshadowed in the structure that extraordinary research \nhas given to the anomaly. Einstein wrote that before he had any \nsubstitute for classical mechanics, he could see the interrelation \nbetween the known anomalies of black-body radiation, the photoelectric \neffect, and specific heats.14 More often no such structure is consciously \nseen in advance. Instead, the new paradigm, or a sufficient hint to \npermit later articulation, emerges \n\n \n13 For the new optical discoveries in general, see V.

What the nature of that final stage is\u2014how an \nindividual invents (or finds he has invented) a new way of giving order \nto data now all assembled\u2014must here remain inscrutable and may be \npermanently so. Let us here note only one thing about it. Almost always \nthe men who achieve these fundamental inventions of a new paradigm \nhave been either very young or very new to the field whose paradigm \nthey change.15 And perhaps that point need not have been made \nexplicit, for obviously these are the men who, being little committed by \nprior practice to the traditional rules of normal science, are particularly \nlikely to see that those rules no longer define a playable game and to \nconceive another set that can replace them. \n\nThe resulting transition to a new paradigm is scientific revolution, a \nsubject that we are at long last prepared to approach directly. Note first, \nhowever, one last and apparently elusive respect in which the material \nof the last three sections has prepared the way. Until Section VI, where \nthe concept of anomaly was first introduced, the terms \u2018revolution\u2019 and \n\u2018extraordinary science\u2019 may have seemed equivalent. More important, \nneither term may have seemed to mean more than \u2018non-normal science,\u2019 \na circularity that will have bothered at least a few readers. In practice, it \nneed not have done so. We are about to discover that a similar circularity \nis characteristic of scientific theories. Bothersome or not, however, that \ncircularity is no longer unqualified. This section of the essay and the two \npreceding have educed numerous criteria of a breakdown in normal \nscientific activity, criteria that do not at all depend upon whether \nbreakdown is succeeded by revolution. Confronted with anomaly or \n\n \n15 This generalization about the role of youth in fundamental scientific research \nis so common as to be a clich\u00e9. Furthermore, a glance at almost any list of \nfundamental contributions to scientific theory will provide impressionistic \nconfirmation. Nevertheless, the generalization badly needs systematic \ninvestigation. Harvey C. Lehman (Age and Achievement [Princeton, 1953]) \nprovides many useful data; but his studies make no attempt to single out \ncontributions that involve fundamental reconceptualization. Nor do they inquire \nabout the special circumstances, if any, that may accompany relatively late \nproductivity in the sciences. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n90 \n\n\n\nThe Response to Crisis \n \nwith crisis, scientists take a different attitude toward existing paradigms, \nand the nature of their research changes accordingly. The proliferation \nof competing articulations, the willingness to try anything, the \nexpression of explicit discontent, the recourse to philosophy and to \ndebate over fundamentals, all these are symptoms of a transition from \nnormal to extraordinary research. It is upon their existence more than \nupon that of revolutions that the notion of normal science depends. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n91 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \nIX. The Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n\n \nThese remarks permit us at last to consider the problems that provide \n\nthis essay with its title. What are scientific revolutions, and what is their \nfunction in scientific development? Much of the answer to these \nquestions has been anticipated in earlier sections. In particular, the \npreceding discussion has indicated that scientific revolutions are here \ntaken to be those non-cumulative developmental episodes in which an \nolder paradigm is replaced in whole or in part by an incompatible new \none. There is more to be said, however, and an essential part of it can be \nintroduced by asking one further question. Why should a change of \nparadigm be called a revolution? In the face of the vast and essential \ndifferences between political and scientific development, what \nparallelism can justify the metaphor that finds revolutions in both? \n\nOne aspect of the parallelism must already be apparent. Political \nrevolutions are inaugurated by a growing sense, often restricted to a \nsegment of the political community, that existing institutions have \nceased adequately to meet the problems posed by an environment that \nthey have in part created. In much the same way, scientific revolutions \nare inaugurated by a growing sense, again often restricted to a narrow \nsubdivision of the scientific community, that an existing paradigm has \nceased to function adequately in the exploration of an aspect of nature \nto which that paradigm itself had previously led the way. In both \npolitical and scientific development the sense of malfunction that can \nlead to crisis is prerequisite to revolution. Furthermore, though it \nadmittedly strains the metaphor, that parallelism holds not only for the \nmajor paradigm changes, like those attributable to Copernicus and \nLavoisier, but also for the far smaller ones associated with the \nassimilation of a new sort of phenomenon, like oxygen or X-rays. \nScientific revolutions, as we noted at the end of Section V, need seem \nrevolutionary only to  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n92 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nthose whose paradigms are affected by them. To outsiders they may, like \nthe Balkan revolutions of the early twentieth century, seem normal \nparts of the developmental process. Astronomers, for example, could \naccept X-rays as a mere addition to knowledge, for their paradigms were \nunaffected by the existence of the new radiation. But for men like \nKelvin, Crookes, and Roentgen, whose research dealt with radiation \ntheory or with cathode ray tubes, the emergence of X-rays necessarily \nviolated one paradigm as it created another. That is why these rays \ncould be discovered only through something\u2019s first going wrong with \nnormal research. \n\nThis genetic aspect of the parallel between political and scientific \ndevelopment should no longer be open to doubt. The parallel has, \nhowever, a second and more profound aspect upon which the \nsignificance of the first depends. Political revolutions aim to change \npolitical institutions in ways that those institutions themselves prohibit. \nTheir success therefore necessitates the partial relinquishment of one \nset of institutions in favor of another, and in the interim, society is not \nfully governed by institutions at all. Initially it is crisis alone that \nattenuates the role of political institutions as we have already seen it \nattenuate the role of paradigms. In increasing numbers individuals \nbecome increasingly estranged from political life and behave more and \nmore eccentrically within it. Then, as the crisis deepens, many of these \nindividuals commit themselves to some concrete proposal for the \nreconstruction of society in a new institutional framework. At that point \nthe society is divided into competing camps or parties, one seeking to \ndefend the old institutional constellation, the others seeking to institute \nsome new one. And, once that polarization has occurred, political \nrecourse fails. Because they differ about the institutional matrix within \nwhich political change is to be achieved and evaluated, because they \nacknowledge no supra-institutional framework for the adjudication of \nrevolutionary difference, the parties to a revolutionary conflict must \nfinally resort to the techniques of mass persuasion, often including \nforce. Though revolutions have had a vital role in the evolution of \npolitical institutions, that role depends upon \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n93 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ntheir being partially extrapolitical or extrainstitutional events. \nThe remainder of this essay aims to demonstrate that the historical \n\nstudy of paradigm change reveals very similar characteristics in the \nevolution of the sciences. Like the choice between competing political \ninstitutions, that between competing paradigms proves to be a choice \nbetween incompatible modes of community life. Because it has that \ncharacter, the choice is not and cannot be determined merely by the \nevaluative procedures characteristic of normal science, for these depend \nin part upon a particular paradigm, and that paradigm is at issue. When \nparadigms enter, as they must, into a debate about paradigm choice, \ntheir role is necessarily circular. Each group uses its own paradigm to \nargue in that paradigm\u2019s defense. \n\nThe resulting circularity does not, of course, make the arguments \nwrong or even ineffectual. The man who premises a paradigm when \narguing in its defense can nonetheless provide a clear exhibit of what \nscientific practice will be like for those who adopt the new view of \nnature. That exhibit can be immensely persuasive, often compellingly \nso. Yet, whatever its force, the status of the circular argument is only \nthat of persuasion. It cannot be made logically or even probabilistically \ncompelling for those who refuse to step into the circle. The premises \nand values shared by the two parties to a debate over paradigms are not \nsufficiently extensive for that. As in political revolutions, so in paradigm \nchoice\u2014there is no standard higher than the assent of the relevant \ncommunity. To discover how scientific revolutions are effected, we shall \ntherefore have to examine not only the impact of nature and of logic, \nbut also the techniques of persuasive argumentation effective within the \nquite special groups that constitute the community of scientists. \n\nTo discover why this issue of paradigm choice can never be \nunequivocally settled by logic and experiment alone, we must shortly \nexamine the nature of the differences that separate the proponents of a \ntraditional paradigm from their revolutionary successors. That \nexamination is the principal object of this section and the next. We have, \nhowever, already noted numerous examples of such differences, and no \none will doubt that history \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n94 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \ncan supply many others. What is more likely to be doubted than their \nexistence\u2014and what must therefore be considered first\u2014is that such \nexamples provide essential information about the nature of science. \nGranting that paradigm rejection has been a historic fact, does it \nilluminate more than human credulity and confusion? Are there \nintrinsic reasons why the assimilation of either a new sort of \nphenomenon or a new scientific theory must demand the rejection of an \nolder paradigm? \n\nFirst notice that if there are such reasons, they do not derive from the \nlogical structure of scientific knowledge. In principle, a new \nphenomenon might emerge without reflecting destructively upon any \npart of past scientific practice. Though discovering life on the moon \nwould today be destructive of existing paradigms (these tell us things \nabout the moon that seem incompatible with life\u2019s existence there), \ndiscovering life in some less well-known part of the galaxy would not. By \nthe same token, a new theory does not have to conflict with any of its \npredecessors. It might deal exclusively with phenomena not previously \nknown, as the quantum theory deals (but, significantly, not exclusively) \nwith subatomic phenomena unknown before the twentieth century. Or \nagain, the new theory might be simply a higher level theory than those \nknown before, one that linked together a whole group of lower level \ntheories without substantially changing any. Today, the theory of energy \nconservation provides just such links between dynamics, chemistry, \nelectricity, optics, thermal theory, and so on. Still other compatible \nrelationships between old and new theories can be conceived. Any and \nall of them might be exemplified by the historical process through which \nscience has developed. If they were, scientific development would be \ngenuinely cumulative. New sorts of phenomena would simply disclose \norder in an aspect of nature where none had been seen before. In the \nevolution of science new knowledge would replace ignorance rather \nthan replace knowledge of another and incompatible sort. \n\nOf course, science (or some other enterprise, perhaps less effective) \nmight have developed in that fully cumulative manner. Many people \nhave believed that it did so, and most still \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n95 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nseem to suppose that cumulation is at least the ideal that historical \ndevelopment would display if only it had not so often been distorted by \nhuman idiosyncrasy. There are important reasons for that belief. In \nSection X we shall discover how closely the view of science-as-\ncumulation is entangled with a dominant epistemology that takes \nknowledge to be a construction placed directly upon raw sense data by \nthe mind. And in Section XI we shall examine the strong support \nprovided to the same historiographic schema by the techniques of \neffective science pedagogy. Nevertheless, despite the immense \nplausibility of that ideal image, there is increasing reason to wonder \nwhether it can possibly be an image of science. After the pre-paradigm \nperiod the assimilation of all new theories and of almost all new sorts of \nphenomena has in fact demanded the destruction of a prior paradigm \nand a consequent conflict between competing schools of scientific \nthought. Cumulative acquisition of unanticipated novelties proves to be \nan almost non-existent exception to the rule of scientific development. \nThe man who takes historic fact seriously must suspect that science does \nnot tend toward the ideal that our image of its cumulativeness has \nsuggested. Perhaps it is another sort of enterprise. \n\nIf, however, resistant facts can carry us that far, then a second look at \nthe ground we have already covered may suggest that cumulative \nacquisition of novelty is not only rare in fact but improbable in \nprinciple. Normal research, which is cumulative, owes its success to the \nability of scientists regularly to select problems that can be solved with \nconceptual and instrumental techniques close to those already in \nexistence. (That is why an excessive concern with useful problems, \nregardless of their relation to existing knowledge and technique, can so \neasily inhibit scientific development.) The man who is striving to solve a \nproblem defined by existing knowledge and technique is not, however, \njust looking around. He knows what he wants to achieve, and he designs \nhis instruments and directs his thoughts accordingly. Unanticipated \nnovelty, the new discovery, can emerge only to the extent that his \nanticipations about nature and his instruments prove wrong. Often the \nimportance of the \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n96 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nresulting discovery will itself be proportional to the extent and \nstubbornness of the anomaly that foreshadowed it. Obviously, then, \nthere must be a conflict between the paradigm that discloses anomaly \nand the one that later renders the anomaly lawlike. The examples of \ndiscovery through paradigm destruction examined in Section VI did not \nconfront us with mere historical accident. There is no other effective \nway in which discoveries might be generated. \n\nThe same argument applies even more clearly to the invention of new \ntheories. There are, in principle, only three types of phenomena about \nwhich a new theory might be developed. The first consists of \nphenomena already well explained by existing paradigms, and these \nseldom provide either motive or point of departure for theory \nconstruction. When they do, as with the three famous anticipations \ndiscussed at the end of Section VII, the theories that result are seldom \naccepted, because nature provides no ground for discrimination. A \nsecond class of phenomena consists of those whose nature is indicated \nby existing paradigms but whose details can be understood only through \nfurther theory articulation. These are the phenomena to which \nscientists direct their research much of the time, but that research aims \nat the articulation of existing paradigms rather than at the invention of \nnew ones. Only when these attempts at articulation fail do scientists \nencounter the third type of phenomena, the recognized anomalies \nwhose characteristic feature is their stubborn refusal to be assimilated to \nexisting paradigms. This type alone gives rise to new theories. Paradigms \nprovide all phenomena except anomalies with a theory-determined \nplace in the scientist\u2019s field of vision. \n\nBut if new theories are called forth to resolve anomalies in the \nrelation of an existing theory to nature, then the successful new theory \nmust somewhere permit predictions that are different from those \nderived from its predecessor. That difference could not occur if the two \nwere logically compatible. In the process of being assimilated, the \nsecond must displace the first. Even a theory like energy conservation, \nwhich today seems a logical superstructure that relates to nature only \nthrough independent- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n97 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nly established theories, did not develop historically without paradigm \ndestruction. Instead, it emerged from a crisis in which an essential \ningredient was the incompatibility between Newtonian dynamics and \nsome recently formulated consequences of the caloric theory of heat. \nOnly after the caloric theory had been rejected could energy \nconservation become part of science.1 And only after it had been part of \nscience for some time could it come to seem a theory of a logically \nhigher type, one not in conflict with its predecessors. It is hard to see \nhow new theories could arise without these destructive changes in \nbeliefs about nature. Though logical inclusiveness remains a permissible \nview of the relation between successive scientific theories, it is a \nhistorical implausibility. \n\nA century ago it would, I think, have been possible to let the case for \nthe necessity of revolutions rest at this point. But today, unfortunately, \nthat cannot be done because the view of the subject developed above \ncannot be maintained if the most prevalent contemporary \ninterpretation of the nature and function of scientific theory is accepted. \nThat interpretation, closely associated with early logical positivism and \nnot categorically rejected by its successors, would restrict the range and \nmeaning of an accepted theory so that it could not possibly conflict with \nany later theory that made predictions about some of the same natural \nphenomena. The best-known and the strongest case for this restricted \nconception of a scientific theory emerges in discussions of the relation \nbetween contemporary Einsteinian dynamics and the older dynamical \nequations that descend from Newton\u2019s Principia. From the viewpoint of \nthis essay these two theories are fundamentally incompatible in the \nsense illustrated by the relation of Copernican to Ptolemaic astronomy: \nEinstein\u2019s theory can be accepted only with the recognition that \nNewton\u2019s was wrong. Today this remains a minority view.2 We must \ntherefore examine the most prevalent objections to it. \n\n \n1 Silvanus P. Thompson, Life of William Thomson Baron Kelvin of Largs \n(London, 1910), I, 266-81. \n2 See, for example, the remarks by P. P. Wiener in Philosophy of Science, \nXXV (1958), 298. \n\n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n98 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nThe gist of these objections can be developed as follows. Relativistic \n\ndynamics cannot have shown Newtonian dynamics to be wrong, for \nNewtonian dynamics is still used with great success by most engineers \nand, in selected applications, by many physicists. Furthermore, the \npropriety of this use of the older theory can be proved from the very \ntheory that has, in other applications, replaced it. Einstein\u2019s theory can \nbe used to show that predictions from Newton\u2019s equations will be as \ngood as our measuring instruments in all applications that satisfy a \nsmall number of restrictive conditions. For example, if Newtonian \ntheory is to provide a good approximate solution, the relative velocities \nof the bodies considered must be small compared with the velocity of \nlight. Subject to this condition and a few others, Newtonian theory \nseems to be derivable from Einsteinian, of which it is therefore a special \ncase. \n\nBut, the objection continues, no theory can possibly conflict with one \nof its special cases. If Einsteinian science seems to make Newtonian \ndynamics wrong, that is only because some Newtonians were so \nincautious as to claim that Newtonian theory yielded entirely precise \nresults or that it was valid at very high relative velocities. Since they \ncould not have had any evidence for such claims, they betrayed the \nstandards of science when they made them. In so far as Newtonian \ntheory was ever a truly scientific theory supported by valid evidence, it \nstill is. Only extravagant claims for the theory\u2014claims that were never \nproperly parts of science\u2014can have been shown by Einstein to be wrong. \nPurged of these merely human extravagances, Newtonian theory has \nnever been challenged and cannot be. \n\nSome variant of this argument is quite sufficient to make any theory \never used by a significant group of competent scientists immune to \nattack. The much-maligned phlogiston theory, for example, gave order \nto a large number of physical and chemical phenomena. It explained \nwhy bodies burned\u2014they were rich in phlogiston\u2014and why metals had \nso many more properties in common than did their ores. The metals \nwere all compounded from different elementary earths combined with \nphlogiston, and the latter, common to all metals, produced common \nprop- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n99 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nerties. In addition, the phlogiston theory accounted for a number of \nreactions in which acids were formed by the combustion of substances \nlike carbon and sulphur. Also, it explained the decrease of volume when \ncombustion occurs in a confined volume of air\u2014the phlogiston released \nby combustion \u201cspoils\u201d the elasticity of the air that absorbed it, just as \nfire \u201cspoils\u201d the elasticity of a steel spring.3 If these were the only \nphenomena that the phlogiston theorists had claimed for their theory, \nthat theory could never have been challenged. A similar argument will \nsuffice for any theory that has ever been successfully applied to any \nrange of phenomena at all. \n\nBut to save theories in this way, their range of application must be \nrestricted to those phenomena and to that precision of observation with \nwhich the experimental evidence in hand already deals.4 Carried just a \nstep further (and the step can scarcely be avoided once the first is \ntaken), such a limitation prohibits the scientist from claiming to speak \n\u201cscientifically\u201d about any phenomenon not already observed. Even in its \npresent form the restriction forbids the scientist to rely upon a theory in \nhis own research whenever that research enters an area or seeks a \ndegree of precision for which past practice with the theory offers no \nprecedent. These prohibitions are logically unexceptionable. But the \nresult of accepting them would be the end of the research through \nwhich science may develop further. \n\nBy now that point too is virtually a tautology. Without commitment to \na paradigm there could be no normal science. Furthermore, that \ncommitment must extend to areas and to degrees of precision for which \nthere is no full precedent.

But these are just the signposts that point \nthe way to extraordinary science. If positivistic restrictions on the range \nof a theory\u2019s legitimate applicability are taken literally, the mechanism \nthat tells the scientific community what problems may lead to \nfundamental change must cease to function. And when that occurs, the \ncommunity will inevitably return to something much like its pre-\nparadigm state, a condition in which all members practice science but in \nwhich their gross product scarcely resembles science at all. Is it really \nany wonder that the price of significant scientific advance is a \ncommitment that runs the risk of being wrong? \n\nMore important, there is a revealing logical lacuna in the positivist\u2019s \nargument, one that will reintroduce us immediately to the nature of \nrevolutionary change. Can Newtonian dynamics really be derived from \nrelativistic dynamics? What would such a derivation look like? Imagine a \nset of statements, E1, E2, . . . , En, which together embody the laws of \nrelativity theory. These statements contain variables and parameters \nrepresenting spatial position, time, rest mass, etc. From them, together \nwith the apparatus of logic and mathematics, is deducible a whole set of \nfurther statements including some that can be checked by observation. \nTo prove the adequacy of Newtonian dynamics as a special case, we \nmust add to the E1\u2019s additional statements, like (v/c)\n\n2 << 1, restricting the \nrange of the parameters and variables. This enlarged set of statements is \nthen manipulated to yield a new set, N1, N2,  . . ., Nm, which is identical \nin form with Newton\u2019s laws of motion, the law of gravity, and so on. \nApparently Newtonian dynamics has been derived from Einsteinian, \nsubject to a few limiting conditions. \n\nYet the derivation is spurious, at least to this point. Though the N1\u2019s \nare a special case of the laws of relativistic mechanics, they are not \nNewton\u2019s Laws. Or at least they are not unless those laws are \nreinterpreted in a way that would have been impossible until after \nEinstein\u2019s work. The variables and parameters that in the Einsteinian \nE1\u2019s represented spatial position, time, mass, etc., still occur in the N1\u2019s; \nand they there still repre- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n101 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nsent Einsteinian space, time, and mass. But the physical referents of \nthese Einsteinian concepts are by no means identical with those of the \nNewtonian concepts that bear the same name. (Newtonian mass is \nconserved; Einsteinian is convertible with energy. Only at low relative \nvelocities may the two be measured in the same way, and even then they \nmust not be conceived to be the same.) Unless we change the definitions \nof the variables in the N1\u2019s, the statements we have derived are not \nNewtonian. If we do change them, we cannot properly be said to have \nderived Newton\u2019s Laws, at least not in any sense of \u201cderive\u201d now \ngenerally recognized. Our argument has, of course, explained why \nNewton\u2019s Laws ever seemed to work. In doing so it has justified, say, an \nautomobile driver in acting as though he lived in a Newtonian universe. \nAn argument of the same type is used to justify teaching earth-centered \nastronomy to surveyors. But the argument has still not done what it \npurported to do. It has not, that is, shown Newton\u2019s Laws to be a limiting \ncase of Einstein\u2019s. For in the passage to the limit it is not only the forms \nof the laws that have changed. Simultaneously we have had to alter the \nfundamental structural elements of which the universe to which they \napply is composed. \n\nThis need to change the meaning of established and familiar concepts \nis central to the revolutionary impact of Einstein\u2019s theory. Though \nsubtler than the changes from geocentrism to heliocentrism, from \nphlogiston to oxygen, or from corpuscles to waves, the resulting \nconceptual transformation is no less decisively destructive of a \npreviously established paradigm. We may even come to see it as a \nprototype for revolutionary reorientations in the sciences. Just because \nit did not involve the introduction of additional objects or concepts, the \ntransition from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics illustrates with \nparticular clarity the scientific revolution as a displacement of the \nconceptual network through which scientists view the world. \n\nThese remarks should suffice to show what might, in another \nphilosophical climate, have been taken for granted. At least for \nscientists, most of the apparent differences between a discarded \nscientific theory and its successor are real. Though an out-of- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n102 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \ndate theory can always be viewed as a special case of its up-to-date \nsuccessor, it must be transformed for the purpose. And the \ntransformation is one that can be undertaken only with the advantages \nof hindsight, the explicit guidance of the more recent theory. \nFurthermore, even if that transformation were a legitimate device to \nemploy in interpreting the older theory, the result of its application \nwould be a theory so restricted that it could only restate what was \nalready known. Because of its economy, that restatement would have \nutility, but it could not suffice for the guidance of research. \n\nLet us, therefore, now take it for granted that the differences between \nsuccessive paradigms are both necessary and irreconcilable. Can we \nthen say more explicitly what sorts of differences these are? The most \napparent type has already been illustrated repeatedly. Successive \nparadigms tell us different things about the population of the universe \nand about that population\u2019s behavior. They differ, that is, about such \nquestions as the existence of subatomic particles, the materiality of \nlight, and the conservation of heat or of energy. These are the \nsubstantive differences between successive paradigms, and they require \nno further illustration. But paradigms differ in more than substance, for \nthey are directed not only to nature but also back upon the science that \nproduced them. They are the source of the methods, problem-field, and \nstandards of solution accepted by any mature scientific community at \nany given time. As a result, the reception of a new paradigm often \nnecessitates a redefinition of the corresponding science. Some old \nproblems may be relegated to another science or declared entirely \n\u201cunscientific.\u201d Others that were previously non-existent or trivial may, \nwith a new paradigm, become the very archetypes of significant \nscientific achievement. And as the problems change, so, often, does the \nstandard that distinguishes a real scientific solution from a mere \nmetaphysical speculation, word game, or mathematical play. The \nnormal-scientific tradition that emerges from a scientific revolution is \nnot only incompatible but often actually incommensurable with that \nwhich has gone before. \n\nThe impact of Newton\u2019s work upon the normal seventeenth- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n103 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ncentury tradition of scientific practice provides a striking example of \nthese subtler effects of paradigm shift. Before Newton was born the \n\u201cnew science\u201d of the century had at last succeeded in rejecting \nAristotelian and scholastic explanations expressed in terms of the \nessences of material bodies. To say that a stone fell because its \u201cnature\u201d \ndrove it toward the center of the universe had been made to look a mere \ntautological word-play, something it had not previously been. \nHenceforth the entire flux of sensory appearances, including color, taste, \nand even weight, was to be explained in terms of the size, shape, \nposition, and motion of the elementary corpuscles of base matter. The \nattribution of other qualities to the elementary atoms was a resort to the \noccult and therefore out of bounds for science. Moli\u00e8re caught the new \nspirit precisely when he ridiculed the doctor who explained opium\u2019s \nefficacy as a soporific by attributing to it a dormitive potency. During \nthe last half of the seventeenth century many scientists preferred to say \nthat the round shape of the opium particles enabled them to sooth the \nnerves about which they moved.5 \n\nIn an earlier period explanations in terms of occult qualities had been \nan integral part of productive scientific work. Nevertheless, the \nseventeenth century\u2019s new commitment to mechanico-corpuscular \nexplanation proved immensely fruitful for a number of sciences, ridding \nthem of problems that had defied generally accepted solution and \nsuggesting others to replace them. In dynamics, for example, Newton\u2019s \nthree laws of motion are less a product of novel experiments than of the \nattempt to reinterpret well-known observations in terms of the motions \nand interactions of primary neutral corpuscles. Consider just one \nconcrete illustration. Since neutral corpuscles could act on each other \nonly by contact, the mechanico-corpuscular view of nature directed \nscientific attention to a brand-new subject of study, the alteration of \nparticulate motions by collisions. Descartes announced the problem and \nprovided its first putative \n \n\n5 For corpuscularism in general, see Marie Boas, \u201cThe Establishment of the \nMechanical Philosophy,\u201d Osiris, X (1952), 412-541. For the effect of particle-shape \non taste, see ibid., p. 483. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n104 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nsolution. Huyghens, Wren, and Wallis carried it still further, partly by \nexperimenting with colliding pendulum bobs, but mostly by applying \npreviously well-known characteristics of motion to the new problem. \nAnd Newton embedded their results in his laws of motion. The equal \n\u201caction\u201d and \u201creaction\u201d of the third law are the changes in quantity of \nmotion experienced by the two parties to a collision. The same change \nof motion supplies the definition of dynamical force implicit in the \nsecond law. In this case, as in many others during the seventeenth \ncentury, the corpuscular paradigm bred both a new problem and a large \npart of that problem\u2019s solution.6 \n\nYet, though much of Newton\u2019s work was directed to problems and \nembodied standards derived from the mechanico-corpuscular world \nview, the effect of the paradigm that resulted from his work was a \nfurther and partially destructive change in the problems and standards \nlegitimate for science. Gravity, interpreted as an innate attraction \nbetween every pair of particles of matter, was an occult quality in the \nsame sense as the scholastics\u2019 \u201ctendency to fall\u201d had been. Therefore, \nwhile the standards of corpuscularism remained in effect, the search for \na mechanical explanation of gravity was one of the most challenging \nproblems for those who accepted the Principia as paradigm. Newton \ndevoted much attention to it and so did many of his eighteenth-century \nsuccessors. The only apparent option was to reject Newton\u2019s theory for \nits failure to explain gravity, and that alternative, too, was widely \nadopted. Yet neither of these views ultimately triumphed. Unable either \nto practice science without the Principia or to make that work conform \nto the corpuscular standards of the seventeenth century, scientists \ngradually accepted the view that gravity was indeed innate. By the mid-\neighteenth century that interpretation had been almost universally \naccepted, and the result was a genuine reversion (which is not the same \nas a retrogression) to a scholastic standard. Innate attractions and \nrepulsions joined size, shape, posi- \n \n6 R.

By the 1740\u2019s, for example, \nelectricians could speak of the attractive \u201cvirtue\u201d of the electric fluid \nwithout thereby inviting the ridicule that had greeted Moli\u00e8re\u2019s doctor a \ncentury before. As they did so, electrical phenomena increasingly \ndisplayed an order different from the one they had shown when viewed \nas the effects of a mechanical effluvium that could act only by contact. \nIn particular, when electrical action-at-a-distance became a subject for \nstudy in its own right, the phenomenon we now call charging by \ninduction could be recognized as one of its effects. Previously, when \nseen at all, it had been attributed to the direct action of electrical \n\u201catmospheres\u201d or to the leakages inevitable in any electrical laboratory. \nThe new view of inductive effects was, in turn, the key to Franklin\u2019s \nanalysis of the Leyden jar and thus to the emergence of a new and \nNewtonian paradigm for electricity. Nor were dynamics and electricity \nthe only scientific fields affected by the legitimization of the search for \nforces innate to matter. The large body of eighteenth-century literature \non chemical affinities and replacement series also derives from this \nsupramechanical aspect of Newtonianism. Chemists who believed in \nthese differential attractions between the various chemical species set \nup previously unimagined experiments and searched for new sorts of \nreactions. Without the data and the chemical concepts developed in that \nprocess, the later work of Lavoisier and, more particularly, of Dalton \nwould be incomprehensible.8 Changes in the standards governing \npermissible problems, concepts, and explanations can transform a \nscience. In the next section I shall even suggest a sense in which they \ntransform the world. \n\n \n7 I. B.

For chemistry, see Metzger, op. cit., Part I. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n106 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nOther examples of these nonsubstantive differences between successive \nparadigms can be retrieved from the history of any science in almost \nany period of its development. For the moment let us be content with \njust two other and far briefer illustrations. Before the chemical \nrevolution, one of the acknowledged tasks of chemistry was to account \nfor the qualities of chemical substances and for the changes these \nqualities underwent during chemical reactions. With the aid of a small \nnumber of elementary \u201cprinciples\u201d\u2014of which phlogiston was one\u2014the \nchemist was to explain why some substances are acidic, others \nmetalline, combustible, and so forth. Some success in this direction had \nbeen achieved. We have already noted that phlogiston explained why \nthe metals were so much alike, and we could have developed a similar \nargument for the acids. Lavoisier\u2019s reform, however, ultimately did away \nwith chemical \u201cprinciples,\u201d and thus ended by depriving chemistry of \nsome actual and much potential explanatory power. To compensate for \nthis loss, a change in standards was required. During much of the \nnineteenth century failure to explain the qualities of compounds was no \nindictment of a chemical theory.9 \n\nOr again, Clerk Maxwell shared with other nineteenth-century \nproponents of the wave theory of light the conviction that light waves \nmust be propagated through a material ether. Designing a mechanical \nmedium to support such waves was a standard problem for many of his \nablest contemporaries. His own theory, however, the electromagnetic \ntheory of light, gave no account at all of a medium able to support light \nwaves, and it clearly made such an account harder to provide than it had \nseemed before. Initially, Maxwell\u2019s theory was widely rejected for those \nreasons. But, like Newton\u2019s theory, Maxwell\u2019s proved difficult to dispense \nwith, and as it achieved the status of a paradigm, the community\u2019s \nattitude toward it changed. In the early decades of the twentieth century \nMaxwell\u2019s insistence upon the existence of a mechanical ether looked \nmore and more like lip service, which it emphatically had not been, and \nthe attempts to design such an ethereal medium were abandoned. \nScientists no \n \n\n9 E. Meyerson, Identity and Reality (New York, 1930), chap. x. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n107 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nlonger thought it unscientific to speak of an electrical \u201cdisplacement\u201d \nwithout specifying what was being displaced. The result, again, was a \nnew set of problems and standards, one which, in the event, had much \nto do with the emergence of relativity theory.10 \n\nThese characteristic shifts in the scientific community\u2019s conception of \nits legitimate problems and standards would have less significance to \nthis essay\u2019s thesis if one could suppose that they always occurred from \nsome methodologically lower to some higher type. In that case their \neffects, too, would seem cumulative. No wonder that some historians \nhave argued that the history of science records a continuing increase in \nthe maturity and refinement of man\u2019s conception of the nature of \nscience.11 Yet the case for cumulative development of science\u2019s problems \nand standards is even harder to make than the case for cumulation of \ntheories. The attempt to explain gravity, though fruitfully abandoned by \nmost eighteenth-century scientists, was not directed to an intrinsically \nillegitimate problem; the objections to innate forces were neither \ninherently unscientific nor metaphysical in some pejorative sense. There \nare no external standards to permit a judgment of that sort. What \noccurred was neither a decline nor a raising of standards, but simply a \nchange demanded by the adoption of a new paradigm. Furthermore, \nthat change has since been reversed and could be again. In the twentieth \ncentury Einstein succeeded in explaining gravitational attractions, and \nthat explanation has returned science to a set of canons and problems \nthat are, in this particular respect, more like those of Newton\u2019s \npredecessors than of his successors. Or again, the development of \nquantum mechanics has reversed the methodological prohibition that \noriginated in the chemical revolution. Chemists now attempt, and with \ngreat success, to explain the color, state of aggregation, and other \nqualities of the substances used and produced in their laboratories. A \nsimilar rever- \n\n \n10 E. T.

Gillispie, The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in \nthe History of Scientific Ideas (Princeton, I960). \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n108 \n\n\n\nThe Nature and Necessity of Scientific Revolutions \n \nsal may even be underway in electromagnetic theory. Space, in \ncontemporary physics, is not the inert and homogenous substratum \nemployed in both Newton\u2019s and Maxwell\u2019s theories; some of its new \nproperties are not unlike those once attributed to the ether; we may \nsomeday come to know what an electric displacement is. \n\nBy shifting emphasis from the cognitive to the normative functions of \nparadigms, the preceding examples enlarge our understanding of the \nways in which paradigms give form to the scientific life. Previously, we \nhad principally examined the paradigm\u2019s role as a vehicle for scientific \ntheory. In that role it functions by telling the scientist about the entities \nthat nature does and does not contain and about the ways in which \nthose entities behave. That information provides a map whose details \nare elucidated by mature scientific research. And since nature is too \ncomplex and varied to be explored at random, that map is as essential as \nobservation and experiment to science\u2019s continuing development. \nThrough the theories they embody, paradigms prove to be constitutive \nof the research activity. They are also, however, constitutive of science in \nother respects, and that is now the point. In particular, our most recent \nexamples show that paradigms provide scientists not only with a map \nbut also with some of the directions essential for map-making. In \nlearning a paradigm the scientist acquires theory, methods, and \nstandards together, usually in an inextricable mixture. Therefore, when \nparadigms change, there are usually significant shifts in the criteria \ndetermining the legitimacy both of problems and of proposed solutions. \n\nThat observation returns us to the point from which this section \nbegan, for it provides our first explicit indication of why the choice \nbetween competing paradigms regularly raises questions that cannot be \nresolved by the criteria of normal science. To the extent, as significant as \nit is incomplete, that two scientific schools disagree about what is a \nproblem and what a solution, they will inevitably talk through each \nother when debating the relative merits of their respective paradigms. \nIn the partially circular arguments that regularly result, each paradigm \nwill be \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n109 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nshown to satisfy more or less the criteria that it dictates for itself and to \nfall short of a few of those dictated by its opponent. There are other \nreasons, too, for the incompleteness of logical contact that consistently \ncharacterizes paradigm debates. For example, since no paradigm ever \nsolves all the problems it defines and since no two paradigms leave all \nthe same problems unsolved, paradigm debates always involve the \nquestion: Which problems is it more significant to have solved? Like the \nissue of competing standards, that question of values can be answered \nonly in terms of criteria that lie outside of normal science altogether, \nand it is that recourse to external criteria that most obviously makes \nparadigm debates revolutionary. Something even more fundamental \nthan standards and values is, however, also at stake. I have so far argued \nonly that paradigms are constitutive of science. Now I wish to display a \nsense in which they are constitutive of nature as well. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n110 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX.  Revolutions as Changes of World View \n \nExamining the record of past research from the vantage of \n\ncontemporary historiography, the historian of science may be tempted \nto exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with \nthem. Led by a new paradigm, scientists adopt new instruments and \nlook in new places. Even more important, during revolutions scientists \nsee new and different things when looking with familiar instruments in \nplaces they have looked before. It is rather as if the professional \ncommunity had been suddenly transported to another planet where \nfamiliar objects are seen in a different light and are joined by unfamiliar \nones as well. Of course, nothing of quite that sort does occur: there is no \ngeographical transplantation; outside the laboratory everyday affairs \nusually continue as before. Nevertheless, paradigm changes do cause \nscientists to see the world of their research-engagement differently. In so \nfar as their only recourse to that world is through what they see and do, \nwe may want to say that after a revolution scientists are responding to a \ndifferent world. \n\nIt is as elementary prototypes for these transformations of the \nscientist\u2019s world that the familiar demonstrations of a switch in visual \ngestalt prove so suggestive. What were ducks in the scientist\u2019s world \nbefore the revolution are rabbits afterwards. The man who first saw the \nexterior of the box from above later sees its interior from below. \nTransformations like these, though usually more gradual and almost \nalways irreversible, are common concomitants of scientific training. \nLooking at a contour map, the student sees lines on paper, the \ncartographer a picture of a terrain. Looking at a bubble-chamber \nphotograph, the student sees confused and broken lines, the physicist a \nrecord of familiar subnuclear events. Only after a number of such \ntransformations of vision does the student become an inhabitant of the \nscientist\u2019s world, seeing what the scientist sees and responding as the \nscientist does. The world that the student then enters \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n111 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nis not, however, fixed once and for all by the nature of the environment, \non the one hand, and of science, on the other. Rather, it is determined \njointly by the environment and the particular normal-scientific tradition \nthat the student has been trained to pursue. Therefore, at times of \nrevolution, when the normal-scientific tradition changes, the scientist\u2019s \nperception of his environment must be re-educated\u2014in some familiar \nsituations he must learn to see a new gestalt. After he has done so the \nworld of his research will seem, here and there, incommensurable with \nthe one he had inhabited before. That is another reason why schools \nguided by different paradigms are always slightly at cross-purposes. \n\nIn their most usual form, of course, gestalt experiments illustrate only \nthe nature of perceptual transformations. They tell us nothing about the \nrole of paradigms or of previously assimilated experience in the process \nof perception. But on that point there is a rich body of psychological \nliterature, much of it stemming from the pioneering work of the \nHanover Institute. An experimental subject who puts on goggles fitted \nwith inverting lenses initially sees the entire world upside down. At the \nstart his perceptual apparatus functions as it had been trained to \nfunction in the absence of the goggles, and the result is extreme \ndisorientation, an acute personal crisis. But after the subject has begun \nto learn to deal with his new world, his entire visual field flips over, \nusually after an intervening period in which vision is simply confused. \nThereafter, objects are again seen as they had been before the goggles \nwere put on. The assimilation of a previously anomalous visual field has \nreacted upon and changed the field itself.1 Literally as well as \nmetaphorically, the man accustomed to inverting lenses has undergone \na revolutionary transformation of vision. \n\nThe subjects of the anomalous playing-card experiment discussed in \nSection VI experienced a quite similar transformation. Until taught by \nprolonged exposure that the universe contained \n \n1 The original experiments were by George M. Stratton, \u201cVision without Inversion \nof the Retinal Image,\u201d Psychological Review, IV (1897), 341-60, 463-81. A more up-\nto-date review is provided by Harvey A.

Yet once experience had provided the \nrequisite additional categories, they were able to see all anomalous cards \non the first inspection long enough to permit any identification at all. \nStill other experiments demonstrate that the perceived size, color, and \nso on, of experimentally displayed objects also varies with the subject\u2019s \nprevious training and experience.2 Surveying the rich experimental \nliterature from which these examples are drawn makes one suspect that \nsomething like a paradigm is prerequisite to perception itself. What a \nman sees depends both upon what he looks at and also upon what his \nprevious visual-conceptual experience has taught him to see. In the \nabsence of such training there can only be, in William James\u2019s phrase, \u201ca \nbloomin\u2019 buzzin\u2019 confusion.\u201d \n\nIn recent years several of those concerned with the history of science \nhave found the sorts of experiments described above immensely \nsuggestive. N. R. Hanson, in particular, has used gestalt demonstrations \nto elaborate some of the same consequences of scientific belief that \nconcern me here.3 Other colleagues have repeatedly noted that history \nof science would make better and more coherent sense if one could \nsuppose that scientists occasionally experienced shifts of perception like \nthose described above. Yet, though psychological experiments are \nsuggestive, they cannot, in the nature of the case, be more than that. \nThey do display characteristics of perception that could be central to \nscientific development, but they do not demonstrate that the careful \nand controlled observation exercised by the research scientist at all \npartakes of those characteristics. Furthermore, the very nature of these \nexperiments makes any direct demonstration of that point impossible. If \nhistorical example is to make these psychological experiments seem \nrele- \n\n \n2 For examples, see Albert H.

Aware that nothing \nin his environment has changed, he directs his attention increasingly \nnot to the figure (duck or rabbit) but to the lines on the paper he is \nlooking at. Ultimately he may even learn to see those lines without \nseeing either of the figures, and he may then say (what he could not \nlegitimately have said earlier) that it is these lines that he really sees but \nthat he sees them alternately as a duck and as a rabbit. By the same \ntoken, the subject of the anomalous card experiment knows (or, more \naccurately, can be persuaded) that his perception must have shifted \nbecause an external authority, the experimenter, assures him that \nregardless of what he saw, he was looking at a black five of hearts all the \ntime. In both these cases, as in all similar psychological experiments, the \neffectiveness of the demonstration depends upon its being analyzable in \nthis way. Unless there were an external standard with respect to which a \nswitch of vision could be demonstrated, no conclusion about alternate \nperceptual possibilities could be drawn. \n\nWith scientific observation, however, the situation is exactly reversed. \nThe scientist can have no recourse above or beyond what he sees with \nhis eyes and instruments. If there were some higher authority by \nrecourse to which his vision might be shown to have shifted, then that \nauthority would itself become the source of his data, and the behavior of \nhis vision would become a source of problems (as that of the \nexperimental subject is for the psychologist). The same sorts of \nproblems would arise if the scientist could switch back and forth like the \nsubject of the gestalt experiments. The period during which light was \n\u201csometimes a wave and sometimes a particle\u201d was a period of crisis\u2014 a \nperiod when something was wrong\u2014and it ended only with the \ndevelopment of wave mechanics and the realization that light was a self-\nconsistent entity different from both waves and particles. In the \nsciences, therefore, if perceptual switches ac- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n114 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \ncompany paradigm changes, we may not expect scientists to attest to \nthese changes directly. Looking at the moon, the convert to \nCopernicanism does not say, \u201cI used to see a planet, but now I see a \nsatellite.\u201d That locution would imply a sense in which the Ptolemaic \nsystem had once been correct. Instead, a convert to the new astronomy \nsays, \u201cI once took the moon to be (or saw the moon as) a planet, but I \nwas mistaken.\u201d That sort of statement does recur in the aftermath of \nscientific revolutions. If it ordinarily disguises a shift of scientific vision \nor some other mental transformation with the same effect, we may not \nexpect direct testimony about that shift. Rather we must look for \nindirect and behavioral evidence that the scientist with a new paradigm \nsees differently from the way he had seen before. \n\nLet us then return to the data and ask what sorts of transformations \nin the scientist\u2019s world the historian who believes in such changes can \ndiscover. Sir William Herschel\u2019s discovery of Uranus provides a first \nexample and one that closely parallels the anomalous card experiment. \nOn at least seventeen different occasions between 1690 and 1781, a \nnumber of astronomers, including several of Europe\u2019s most eminent \nobservers, had seen a star in positions that we now suppose must have \nbeen occupied at the time by Uranus. One of the best observers in this \ngroup had actually seen the star on four successive nights in 1769 \nwithout noting the motion that could have suggested another \nidentification. Herschel, when he first observed the same object twelve \nyears later, did so with a much improved telescope of his own \nmanufacture. As a result, he was able to notice an apparent disk-size \nthat was at least unusual for stars. Something was awry, and he therefore \npostponed identification pending further scrutiny. That scrutiny \ndisclosed Uranus\u2019 motion among the stars, and Herschel therefore \nannounced that he had seen a new comet! Only several months later, \nafter fruitless attempts to fit the observed motion to a cometary orbit, \ndid Lexell suggest that the orbit was probably planetary.4 When that \nsuggestion was accepted, there were several fewer stars and one more \nplanet in the world of the professional astronomer. A celestial body that \n \n\n4 Peter Doig, A Concise History of Astronomy (London, 1950), pp. 115-16. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n115 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nhad been observed off and on for almost a century was seen differently \nafter 1781 because, like an anomalous playing card, it could no longer be \nfitted to the perceptual categories (star or comet) provided by the \nparadigm that had previously prevailed. \n\nThe shift of vision that enabled astronomers to see Uranus, the \nplanet, does not, however, seem to have affected only the perception of \nthat previously observed object. Its consequences were more far-\nreaching. Probably, though the evidence is equivocal, the minor \nparadigm change forced by Herschel helped to prepare astronomers for \nthe rapid discovery, after 1801, of the numerous minor planets or \nasteroids. Because of their small size, these did not display the \nanomalous magnification that had alerted Herschel. Nevertheless, \nastronomers prepared to find additional planets were able, with \nstandard instruments, to identify twenty of them in the first fifty years \nof the nineteenth century.5 The history of astronomy provides many \nother examples of paradigm-induced changes in scientific perception, \nsome of them even less equivocal. Can it conceivably be an accident, for \nexample, that Western astronomers first saw change in the previously \nimmutable heavens during the half-century after Copernicus\u2019 new \nparadigm was first proposed? The Chinese, whose cosmological beliefs \ndid not preclude celestial change, had recorded the appearance of many \nnew stars in the heavens at a much earlier date. Also, even without the \naid of a telescope, the Chinese had systematically recorded the \nappearance of sunspots centuries before these were seen by Galileo and \nhis contemporaries.6 Nor were sunspots and a new star the only \nexamples of celestial change to emerge in the heavens of Western \nastronomy immediately after Copernicus. Using traditional instruments, \nsome as simple as a piece of thread, late sixteenth-century astronomers \nrepeatedly discovered that comets wandered at will through the space \npreviously reserved for the \n\n \n5 Rudolph Wolf, Geschichte der Astronomie (Munich, 1877), pp. 513-15, 683-93. \nNotice particularly how difficult Wolf\u2019s account makes it to explain these \ndiscoveries as a consequence of Bode\u2019s Law. \n6 Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, III (Cambridge, 1959), 423-\n29, 434-36. \n\n \n\nVol. II, No. 2 \n116 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \nimmutable planets and stars.7 The very ease and rapidity with which \nastronomers saw new things when looking at old objects with old \ninstruments may make us wish to say that, after Copernicus, \nastronomers lived in a different world. In any case, their research \nresponded as though that were the case. \n\nThe preceding examples are selected from astronomy because reports \nof celestial observation are frequently delivered in a vocabulary \nconsisting of relatively pure observation terms. Only in such reports can \nwe hope to find anything like a full parallelism between the observations \nof scientists and those of the psychologist\u2019s experimental subjects. But \nwe need not insist on so full a parallelism, and we have much to gain by \nrelaxing our standard. If we can be content with the everyday use of the \nverb \u2018to see,\u2019 we may quickly recognize that we have already \nencountered many other examples of the shifts in scientific perception \nthat accompany paradigm change. The extended use of \u2018perception\u2019 and \nof \u2018seeing\u2019 will shortly require explicit defense, but let me first illustrate \nits application in practice. \n\nLook again for a moment at two of our previous examples from the \nhistory of electricity. During the seventeenth century, when their \nresearch was guided by one or another effluvium theory, electricians \nrepeatedly saw chaff particles rebound from, or fall off, the electrified \nbodies that had attracted them. At least that is what seventeenth-\ncentury observers said they saw, and we have no more reason to doubt \ntheir reports of perception than our own. Placed before the same \napparatus, a modern observer would see electrostatic repulsion (rather \nthan mechanical or gravitational rebounding), but historically, with one \nuniversally ignored exception, electrostatic repulsion was not seen as \nsuch until Hauksbee\u2019s large-scale apparatus had greatly magnified its \neffects. Repulsion after contact electrification was, however, only one of \nmany new repulsive effects that Hauksbee saw. Through his researches, \nrather as in a gestalt switch, repulsion suddenly became the \nfundamental manifestation of electrification, and it was then attraction \nthat needed to be ex- \n\n \n7 T. S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution (Cambridge, Mass., 1957), pp. 206-9. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n117 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nplained.8 The electrical phenomena visible in the early eighteenth \ncentury were both subtler and more varied than those seen by observers \nin the seventeenth century. Or again, after the assimilation of Franklin\u2019s \nparadigm, the electrician looking at a Leyden jar saw something \ndifferent from what he had seen before. The device had become a \ncondenser, for which neither the jar shape nor glass was required. \nInstead, the two conducting coatings\u2014one of which had been no part of \nthe original device-emerged to prominence. As both written discussions \nand pictorial representations gradually attest, two metal plates with a \nnon-conductor between them had become the prototype for the class.9 \nSimultaneously, other inductive effects received new descriptions, and \nstill others were noted for the first time. \n\nShifts of this sort are not restricted to astronomy and electricity. We \nhave already remarked some of the similar transformations of vision \nthat can be drawn from the history of chemistry. Lavoisier, we said, saw \noxygen where Priestley had seen de-phlogisticated air and where others \nhad seen nothing at all. In learning to see oxygen, however, Lavoisier \nalso had to change his view of many other more familiar substances. He \nhad, for example, to see a compound ore where Priestley and his \ncontemporaries had seen an elementary earth, and there were other \nsuch changes besides. At the very least, as a result of discovering oxygen, \nLavoisier saw nature differently. And in the absence of some recourse to \nthat hypothetical fixed nature that he \u201csaw differently,\u201d the principle of \neconomy will urge us to say that after discovering oxygen Lavoisier \nworked in a different world. \n\nI shall inquire in a moment about the possibility of avoiding this \nstrange locution, but first we require an additional example of its use, \nthis one deriving from one of the best known parts of the work of \nGalileo. Since remote antiquity most people have seen one or another \nheavy body swinging back and forth on a string or chain until it finally \ncomes to rest. To the Aristotelians, \n\n \n8 Duane Roller and Duane H. D. Roller, The Development of the Concept of \nElectric Charge (Cambridge, Mass., 1954), pp. 21-29. \n9 See the discussion in Section VII and the literature to which the reference \nthere cited in note 9 will lead. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n118 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \nwho believed that a heavy body is moved by its own nature from a \nhigher position to a state of natural rest at a lower one, the swinging \nbody was simply falling with difficulty. Constrained by the chain, it \ncould achieve rest at its low point only after a tortuous motion and a \nconsiderable time. Galileo, on the other hand, looking at the swinging \nbody, saw a pendulum, a body that almost succeeded in repeating the \nsame motion over and over again ad infinitum. And having seen that \nmuch, Galileo observed other properties of the pendulum as well and \nconstructed many of the most significant and original parts of his new \ndynamics around them. From the properties of the pendulum, for \nexample, Galileo derived his only full and sound arguments for the \nindependence of weight and rate of fall, as well as for the relationship \nbetween vertical height and terminal velocity of motions down inclined \nplanes.10 All these natural phenomena he saw differently from the way \nthey had been seen before. \n\nWhy did that shift of vision occur? Through Galileo\u2019s individual \ngenius, of course. But note that genius does not here manifest itself in \nmore accurate or objective observation of the swinging body. \nDescriptively, the Aristotelian perception is just as accurate. When \nGalileo reported that the pendulum\u2019s period was independent of \namplitude for amplitudes as great as 90\u00b0, his view of the pendulum led \nhim to see far more regularity than we can now discover there.11 Rather, \nwhat seems to have been involved was the exploitation by genius of \nperceptual possibilities made available by a medieval paradigm shift. \nGalileo was not raised completely as an Aristotelian. On the contrary, he \nwas trained to analyze motions in terms of the impetus theory, a late \nmedieval paradigm which held that the continuing motion of a heavy \nbody is due to an internal power implanted in it by the projector that \ninitiated its motion. Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme, the fourteenth-\ncentury scholastics who brought the impetus theory to its most perfect \nformulations, are the first men \n\n \n10 Galileo Galilei, Dialogues concerning Two New Sciences, trans. H. Crew and A. de \nSalvio  (Evanston, Ill., 1946), pp. 80-81, 162-66. \n11  Ibid., pp. 91-94, 244. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n119 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nknown to have seen in oscillatory motions any part of what Galileo saw \nthere. Buridan describes the motion of a vibrating string as one in which \nimpetus is first implanted when the string is struck; the impetus is next \nconsumed in displacing the string against the resistance of its tension; \ntension then carries the string back, implanting increasing impetus until \nthe mid-point of motion is reached; after that the impetus displaces the \nstring in the opposite direction, again against the string\u2019s tension, and so \non in a symmetric process that may continue indefinitely. Later in the \ncentury Oresme sketched a similar analysis of the swinging stone in \nwhat now appears as the first discussion of a pendulum.12 His view is \nclearly very close to the one with which Galileo first approached the \npendulum. At least in Oresme\u2019s case, and almost certainly in Galileo\u2019s as \nwell, it was a view made possible by the transition from the original \nAristotelian to the scholastic impetus paradigm for motion. Until that \nscholastic paradigm was invented, there were no pendulums, but only \nswinging stones, for the scientist to see. Pendulums were brought into \nexistence by something very like a paradigm-induced gestalt switch. \n\nDo we, however, really need to describe what separates Galileo from \nAristotle, or Lavoisier from Priestley, as a transformation of vision? Did \nthese men really see different things when looking at the same sorts of \nobjects? Is there any legitimate sense in which we can say that they \npursued their research in different worlds? Those questions can no \nlonger be postponed, for there is obviously another and far more usual \nway to describe all of the historical examples outlined above. Many \nreaders will surely want to say that what changes with a paradigm is \nonly the scientist\u2019s interpretation of observations that themselves are \nfixed once and for all by the nature of the environment and of the \nperceptual apparatus. On this view, Priestley and Lavoisier both saw \noxygen, but they interpreted their observations differently; Aristotle and \nGalileo both saw pendu- \n \n\n12 M. Clagett, The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages (Madison, Wis., 1959), \npp. 537-38,570. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n120 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \nlums, but they differed in their interpretations of what they both had \nseen. \n\nLet me say at once that this very usual view of what occurs when \nscientists change their minds about fundamental matters can be neither \nall wrong nor a mere mistake. Rather it is an essential part of a \nphilosophical paradigm initiated by Descartes and developed at the \nsame time as Newtonian dynamics. That paradigm has served both \nscience and philosophy well. Its exploitation, like that of dynamics itself, \nhas been fruitful of a fundamental understanding that perhaps could \nnot have been achieved in another way. But as the example of \nNewtonian dynamics also indicates, even the most striking past success \nprovides no guarantee that crisis can be indefinitely postponed. Today \nresearch in parts of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, and even art \nhistory, all converge to suggest that the traditional paradigm is somehow \naskew. That failure to fit is also made increasingly apparent by the \nhistorical study of science to which most of our attention is necessarily \ndirected here. \n\nNone of these crisis-promoting subjects has yet produced a viable \nalternate to the traditional epistemological paradigm, but they do begin \nto suggest what some of that paradigm\u2019s characteristics will be. I am, for \nexample, acutely aware of the difficulties created by saying that when \nAristotle and Galileo looked at swinging stones, the first saw constrained \nfall, the second a pendulum. The same difficulties are presented in an \neven more fundamental form by the opening sentences of this section: \nthough the world does not change with a change of paradigm, the \nscientist afterward works in a different world. Nevertheless, I am \nconvinced that we must learn to make sense of statements that at least \nresemble these. What occurs during a scientific revolution is not fully \nreducible to a reinterpretation of individual and stable data. In the first \nplace, the data are not unequivocally stable. A pendulum is not a falling \nstone, nor is oxygen dephlogisticated air. Consequently, the data that \nscientists collect from these diverse objects are, as we shall shortly see, \nthemselves different.  More  important,  the process  by which \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n121 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\neither the individual or the community makes the transition from \nconstrained fall to the pendulum or from dephlogisticated air to oxygen \nis not one that resembles interpretation. How could it do so in the \nabsence of fixed data for the scientist to interpret? Rather than being an \ninterpreter, the scientist who embraces a new paradigm is like the man \nwearing inverting lenses. Confronting the same constellation of objects \nas before and knowing that he does so, he nevertheless finds them \ntransformed through and through in many of their details. \n\nNone of these remarks is intended to indicate that scientists do not \ncharacteristically interpret observations and data. On the contrary, \nGalileo interpreted observations on the pendulum, Aristotle \nobservations on falling stones, Musschenbroek observations on a charge-\nfilled bottle, and Franklin observations on a condenser. But each of these \ninterpretations presupposed a paradigm. They were parts of normal \nscience, an enterprise that, as we have already seen, aims to refine, \nextend, and articulate a paradigm that is already in existence. Section III \nprovided many examples in which interpretation played a central role. \nThose examples typify the overwhelming majority of research. In each \nof them the scientist, by virtue of an accepted paradigm, knew what a \ndatum was, what instruments might be used to retrieve it, and what \nconcepts were relevant to its interpretation. Given a paradigm, \ninterpretation of data is central to the enterprise that explores it. \n\nBut that interpretive enterprise\u2014and this was the burden of the \nparagraph before last\u2014can only articulate a paradigm, not correct it. \nParadigms are not corrigible by normal science at all. Instead, as we \nhave already seen, normal science ultimately leads only to the \nrecognition of anomalies and to crises. And these are terminated, not by \ndeliberation and interpretation, but by a relatively sudden and \nunstructured event like the gestalt switch. Scientists then often speak of \nthe \u201cscales falling from the eyes\u201d or of the \u201clightning flash\u201d that \n\u201cinundates\u201d a previously obscure puzzle, enabling its components to be \nseen in a new way that for the first time permits its solution. On other \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n122 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \noccasions the relevant illumination comes in sleep.13 No ordinary sense \nof the term \u2018interpretation\u2019 fits these flashes of intuition through which a \nnew paradigm is born. Though such intuitions depend upon the \nexperience, both anomalous and congruent, gained with the old \nparadigm, they are not logically or piecemeal linked to particular items \nof that experience as an interpretation would be. Instead, they gather up \nlarge portions of that experience and transform them to the rather \ndifferent bundle of experience that will thereafter be linked piecemeal \nto the new paradigm but not to the old. \n\nTo learn more about what these differences in experience can be, \nreturn for a moment to Aristotle, Galileo, and the pendulum. What data \ndid the interaction of their different paradigms and their common \nenvironment make accessible to each of them? Seeing constrained fall, \nthe Aristotelian would measure (or at least discuss\u2014the Aristotelian \nseldom measured) the weight of the stone, the vertical height to which it \nhad been raised, and the time required for it to achieve rest. Together \nwith the resistance of the medium, these were the conceptual categories \ndeployed by Aristotelian science when dealing with a falling body.14 \nNormal research guided by them could not have produced the laws that \nGalileo discovered. It could only\u2014and by another route it did\u2014lead to \nthe series of crises from which Galileo\u2019s view of the swinging stone \nemerged. As a result of those crises and of other intellectual changes \nbesides, Galileo saw the swinging stone quite differently. Archimedes\u2019 \nwork on floating bodies made the medium non-essential; the impetus \ntheory rendered the motion symmetrical and enduring; and \nNeoplatonism directed Galileo\u2019s attention to the motion\u2019s circu- \n\n \n13 [Jacques] Hadamard, Subconscient intuition, et logique dans la recherche \nscientifique (Conf\u00e9rence faite au Palais de la D\u00e9couverte le 8 D\u00e9cembre 1945 \n[Alen\u00e7on, n.d.]), pp. 7-8.

In the \nevent, interpretation proved almost unnecessary. Given Galileo\u2019s \nparadigms, pendulum-like regularities were very nearly accessible to \ninspection. How else are we to account for Galileo\u2019s discovery that the \nbob\u2019s period is entirely independent of amplitude, a discovery that the \nnormal science stemming from Galileo had to eradicate and that we are \nquite unable to document today. Regularities that could not have existed \nfor an Aristotelian (and that are, in fact, nowhere precisely exemplified \nby nature) were consequences of immediate experience for the man \nwho saw the swinging stone as Galileo did. \n\nPerhaps that example is too fanciful since the Aristotelians recorded \nno discussions of swinging stones. On their paradigm it was an \nextraordinarily complex phenomenon. But the Aristotelians did discuss \nthe simpler case, stones falling without uncommon constraints, and the \nsame differences of vision are apparent there. Contemplating a falling \nstone, Aristotle saw a change of state rather than a process. For him the \nrelevant measures of a motion were therefore total distance covered and \ntotal time elapsed, parameters which yield what we should now call not \nspeed but average speed.16 Similarly, because the stone was impelled by \nits nature to reach its final resting point, Aristotle saw the relevant \ndistance parameter at any instant during the motion as the distance to \nthe final end point rather than as that from the origin of motion.17 Those \nconceptual parameters underlie and give sense to most of his well-\nknown \u201claws of motion.\u201d Partly through the impetus paradigm, however, \nand partly through a doctrine known as the latitude of forms, scholastic \ncriticism changed this way of viewing motion.

In addition, Aristotle\u2019s notion of speed was \nbifurcated by the scholastics into concepts that soon after Galileo \nbecame our average speed and instantaneous speed. But when seen \nthrough the paradigm of which these conceptions were a part, the \nfalling stone, like the pendulum, exhibited its governing laws almost on \ninspection. Galileo was not one of the first men to suggest that stones \nfall with a uniformly accelerated motion.18 Furthermore, he had \ndeveloped his theorem on this subject together with many of its \nconsequences before he experimented with an inclined plane. That \ntheorem was another one of the network of new regularities accessible \nto genius in the world determined jointly by nature and by the \nparadigms upon which Galileo and his contemporaries had been raised. \nLiving in that world, Galileo could still, when he chose, explain why \nAristotle had seen what he did. Nevertheless, the immediate content of \nGalileo\u2019s experience with falling stones was not what Aristotle\u2019s had \nbeen. \n\nIt is, of course, by no means clear that we need be so concerned with \n\u201cimmediate experience\u201d\u2014that is, with the perceptual features that a \nparadigm so highlights that they surrender their regularities almost \nupon inspection. Those features must obviously change with the \nscientist\u2019s commitments to paradigms, but they are far from what we \nordinarily have in mind when we speak of the raw data or the brute \nexperience from which scientific research is reputed to proceed. Perhaps \nimmediate experience should be set aside as fluid, and we should \ndiscuss instead the concrete operations and measurements that the \nscientist performs in his laboratory. Or perhaps the analysis should be \ncarried further still from the immediately given. It might, for example, \nbe conducted in terms of some neutral observation-language, perhaps \none designed to conform to the retinal imprints that mediate what the \nscientist sees. Only in one of these ways can we hope to retrieve a realm \nin which experience is again stable once and for all\u2014in which the \npendulum and constrained fall are not different perceptions but rather \n \n\n18 Clagett, op. cit., chaps, iv, vi, and ix. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n125 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\ndifferent interpretations of the unequivocal data provided by \nobservation of a swinging stone. \n\nBut is sensory experience fixed and neutral? Are theories simply man-\nmade interpretations of given data? The epistemological viewpoint that \nhas most often guided Western philosophy for three centuries dictates \nan immediate and unequivocal, Yes! In the absence of a developed \nalternative, I find it impossible to relinquish entirely that viewpoint. Yet \nit no longer functions effectively, and the attempts to make it do so \nthrough the introduction of a neutral language of observations now \nseem to me hopeless. \n\nThe operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the \nlaboratory are not \u201cthe given\u201d of experience but rather \u201cthe collected \nwith difficulty.\u201d They are not what the scientist sees\u2014at least not before \nhis research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are \nconcrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as \nsuch they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only \nbecause they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an \naccepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience \nfrom which they in part derive, operations and measurements are \nparadigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory \nmanipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a \nparadigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has \npartially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms \nengage in different concrete laboratory manipulations. The \nmeasurements to be performed on a pendulum are not the ones \nrelevant to a case of constrained fall. Nor are the operations relevant for \nthe elucidation of oxygen\u2019s properties uniformly the same as those \nrequired when investigating the characteristics of dephlogisticated air. \n\nAs for a pure observation-language, perhaps one will yet be devised. \nBut three centuries after Descartes our hope for such an eventuality still \ndepends exclusively upon a theory of perception and of the mind. And \nmodern psychological experimentation is rapidly proliferating \nphenomena with which that theory can scarcely deal. The duck-rabbit \nshows that two men \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n126 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \nwith the same retinal impressions can see different things; the inverting \nlenses show that two men with different retinal impressions can see the \nsame thing. Psychology supplies a great deal of other evidence to the \nsame effect, and the doubts that derive from it are readily reinforced by \nthe history of attempts to exhibit an actual language of observation. No \ncurrent attempt to achieve that end has yet come close to a generally \napplicable language of pure percepts. And those attempts that come \nclosest share one characteristic that strongly reinforces several of this \nessay\u2019s main theses. From the start they presuppose a paradigm, taken \neither from a current scientific theory or from some fraction of everyday \ndiscourse, and they then try to eliminate from it all non-logical and non-\nperceptual terms. In a few realms of discourse this effort has been \ncarried very far and with fascinating results. There can be no question \nthat efforts of this sort are worth pursuing. But their result is a language \nthat\u2014like those employed in the sciences\u2014embodies a host of \nexpectations about nature and fails to function the moment these \nexpectations are violated. Nelson Goodman makes exactly this point in \ndescribing the aims of his Structure of Appearance: \u201cIt is fortunate that \nnothing more [than phenomena known to exist] is in question; for the \nnotion of \u2018possible\u2019 cases, of cases that do not exist but might have \nexisted, is far from clear.\u201d19 No language thus restricted to reporting a \nworld fully known in advance can produce mere neutral and objective \nreports on \u201cthe given.\u201d Philosophical investigation has not yet provided \neven a hint of what a language able to do that would be like. \n\nUnder these circumstances we may at least suspect that scientists are \nright in principle as well as in practice when they treat \n \n19 N. Goodman, The Structure of Appearance (Cambridge, Mass., 1951), pp. 4-5. \nThe passage is worth quoting more extensively: \u201cIf all and only those residents of \nWilmington in 1947 that weigh between 175 and 180 pounds have red hair, then \n\u2018red-haired 1947 resident of Wilmington\u2019 and \u20181947 resident of Wilmington \nweighing between 175 and 180 pounds\u2019 may be joined in a constructional \ndefinition. . . . The question whether there \u2018might have been\u2019 someone to whom \none but not the other of these predicates would apply has no bearing . . . once we \nhave determined that there is no such person. . . . It is fortunate that nothing \nmore is in question; for the notion of \u2018possible\u2019 cases, of cases that do not exist but \nmight have existed, is far from clear.\u201d \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n127 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\noxygen and pendulums (and perhaps also atoms and electrons) as the \nfundamental ingredients of their immediate experience. As a result of \nthe paradigm-embodied experience of the race, the culture, and, finally, \nthe profession, the world of the scientist has come to be populated with \nplanets and pendulums, condensers and compound ores, and other such \nbodies besides. Compared with these objects of perception, both meter \nstick readings and retinal imprints are elaborate constructs to which \nexperience has direct access only when the scientist, for the special \npurposes of his research, arranges that one or the other should do so. \nThis is not to suggest that pendulums, for example, are the only things a \nscientist could possibly see when looking at a swinging stone. (We have \nalready noted that members of another scientific community could see \nconstrained fall.) But it is to suggest that the scientist who looks at a \nswinging stone can have no experience that is in principle more \nelementary than seeing a pendulum. The alternative is not some \nhypothetical \u201cfixed\u201d vision, but vision through another paradigm, one \nwhich makes the swinging stone something else. \n\nAll of this may seem more reasonable if we again remember that \nneither scientists nor laymen learn to see the world piecemeal or item \nby item. Except when all the conceptual and manipulative categories are \nprepared in advance\u2014e.g., for the discovery of an additional transuranic \nelement or for catching sight of a new house\u2014both scientists and laymen \nsort out whole areas together from the flux of experience. The child who \ntransfers the word \u2018mama\u2019 from all humans to all females and then to his \nmother is not just learning what \u2018mama\u2019 means or who his mother is. \nSimultaneously he is learning some of the differences between males \nand females as well as something about the ways in which all but one \nfemale will behave toward him. His reactions, expectations, and beliefs\u2014\nindeed, much of his perceived world\u2014change accordingly. By the same \ntoken, the Copernicans who denied its traditional title \u2018planet\u2019 to the sun \nwere not only learning what \u2018planet\u2019 meant or what the sun was. Instead, \nthey were changing the meaning of \u2018planet\u2019 so that it could continue to \nmake useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies, \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n128 \n\n\n\nRevolutions as Changes of World View \n \nnot just the sun, were seen differently from the way they had been seen \nbefore. The same point could be made about any of our earlier \nexamples. To see oxygen instead of dephlogisticated air, the condenser \ninstead of the Leyden jar, or the pendulum instead of constrained fall, \nwas only one part of an integrated shift in the scientist\u2019s vision of a great \nmany related chemical, electrical, or dynamical phenomena. Paradigms \ndetermine large areas of experience at the same time. \n\nIt is, however, only after experience has been thus determined that \nthe search for an operational definition or a pure observation-language \ncan begin. The scientist or philosopher who asks what measurements or \nretinal imprints make the pendulum what it is must already be able to \nrecognize a pendulum when he sees one. If he saw constrained fall \ninstead, his question could not even be asked. And if he saw a \npendulum, but saw it in the same way he saw a tuning fork or an \noscillating balance, his question could not be answered. At least it could \nnot be answered in the same way, because it would not be the same \nquestion. Therefore, though they are always legitimate and are \noccasionally extraordinarily fruitful, questions about retinal imprints or \nabout the consequences of particular laboratory manipulations \npresuppose a world already perceptually and conceptually subdivided in \na certain way. In a sense such questions are parts of normal science, for \nthey depend upon the existence of a paradigm and they receive \ndifferent answers as a result of paradigm change. \n\nTo conclude this section, let us henceforth neglect retinal impressions \nand again restrict attention to the laboratory operations that provide the \nscientist with concrete though fragmentary indices to what he has \nalready seen. One way in which such laboratory operations change with \nparadigms has already been observed repeatedly. After a scientific \nrevolution many old measurements and manipulations become \nirrelevant and are replaced by others instead. One does not apply all the \nsame tests to oxygen as to dephlogisticated air. But changes of this sort \nare never total. Whatever he may then see, the scientist after a \nrevolution is still looking at the same world. Further- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n129 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nmore, though he may previously have employed them differently, much \nof his language and most of his laboratory instruments are still the same \nas they were before. As a result, postrevolutionary science invariably \nincludes many of the same manipulations, performed with the same \ninstruments and described in the same terms, as its prerevolutionary \npredecessor. If these enduring manipulations have been changed at all, \nthe change must lie either in their relation to the paradigm or in their \nconcrete results. I now suggest, by the introduction of one last new \nexample, that both these sorts of changes occur. Examining the work of \nDalton and his contemporaries, we shall discover that one and the same \noperation, when it attaches to nature through a different paradigm, can \nbecome an index to a quite different aspect of nature\u2019s regularity. In \naddition, we shall see that occasionally the old manipulation in its new \nrole will yield different concrete results. \n\nThroughout much of the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth, \nEuropean chemists almost universally believed that the elementary \natoms of which all chemical species consisted were held together by \nforces of mutual affinity. Thus a lump of silver cohered because of the \nforces of affinity between silver corpuscles (until after Lavoisier these \ncorpuscles were themselves thought of as compounded from still more \nelementary particles). On the same theory silver dissolved in acid (or \nsalt in water) because the particles of acid attracted those of silver (or \nthe particles of water attracted those of salt) more strongly than \nparticles of these solutes attracted each other. Or again, copper would \ndissolve in the silver solution and precipitate silver, because the copper-\nacid affinity was greater than the affinity of acid for silver. A great many \nother phenomena were explained in the same way. In the eighteenth \ncentury the theory of elective affinity was an admirable chemical \nparadigm, widely and sometimes fruitfully deployed in the design and \nanalysis of chemical experimentation.20 \n\nAffinity theory, however, drew the line separating physical \n \n\n20 H.

Eighteenth-century \nchemists did recognize two sorts of processes. When mixing produced \nheat, light, effervescence or something else of the sort, chemical union \nwas seen to have taken place. If, on the other hand, the particles in the \nmixture could be distinguished by eye or mechanically separated, there \nwas only physical mixture. But in the very large number of intermediate \ncases\u2014salt in water, alloys, glass, oxygen in the atmosphere, and so on\u2014\nthese crude criteria were of little use. Guided by their paradigm, most \nchemists viewed this entire intermediate range as chemical, because the \nprocesses of which it consisted were all governed by forces of the same \nsort. Salt in water or oxygen in nitrogen was just as much an example of \nchemical combination as was the combination produced by oxidizing \ncopper. The arguments for viewing solutions as compounds were very \nstrong. Affinity theory itself was well attested. Besides, the formation of \na compound accounted for a solution\u2019s observed homogeneity. If, for \nexample, oxygen and nitrogen were only mixed and not combined in the \natmosphere, then the heavier gas, oxygen, should settle to the bottom. \nDalton, who took the atmosphere to be a mixture, was never \nsatisfactorily able to explain oxygen\u2019s failure to do so. The assimilation \nof his atomic theory ultimately created an anomaly where there had \nbeen none before.21 \n\nOne is tempted to say that the chemists who viewed solutions as \ncompounds differed from their successors only over a matter of \ndefinition. In one sense that may have been the case. But that sense is \nnot the one that makes definitions mere conventional conveniences. In \nthe eighteenth century mixtures were not fully distinguished from \ncompounds by operational tests, and perhaps they could not have been. \nEven if chemists had looked for such tests, they would have sought \ncriteria that made the solution a compound. The mixture-compound \ndistinction was part of their paradigm\u2014part of the way they viewed their \nwhole \n \n\n21 Ibid., pp. 124-29, 139-48. For Dalton, see Leonard K.

In particular, while solutions \nremained compounds, no amount of chemical experimentation could by \nitself have produced the law of fixed proportions. At the end of the \neighteenth century it was widely known that some compounds ordinarily \ncontained fixed proportions by weight of their constituents. For some \ncategories of reactions the German chemist Richter had even noted the \nfurther regularities now embraced by the law of chemical equivalents.22 \n\nBut no chemist made use of these regularities except in recipes, and no \none until almost the end of the century thought of generalizing them. \nGiven the obvious counterinstances, like glass or like salt in water, no \ngeneralization was possible without an abandonment of affinity theory \nand a reconceptualization of the boundaries of the chemist\u2019s domain. \nThat consequence became explicit at the very end of the century in a \nfamous debate between the French chemists Proust and Berthollet. The \nfirst claimed that all chemical reactions occurred in fixed proportion, \nthe latter that they did not. Each collected impressive experimental \nevidence for his view. Nevertheless, the two men necessarily talked \nthrough each other, and their debate was entirely inconclusive. Where \nBerthollet saw a compound that could vary in proportion, Proust saw \nonly a physical mixture.23 To that issue neither experiment nor a change \nof definitional convention could be relevant. The two men were as \nfundamentally at cross-purposes as Galileo and Aristotle had been. \n\nThis was the situation during the years when John Dalton undertook \nthe investigations that led finally to his famous chemical atomic theory. \nBut until the very last stages of those investiga- \n\n \n22 J.

Instead, \nhe was a meteorologist investigating the, for him, physical problems of \nthe absorption of gases by water and of water by the atmosphere. Partly \nbecause his training was in a different specialty and partly because of \nhis own work in that specialty, he approached these problems with a \nparadigm different from that of contemporary chemists. In particular, \nhe viewed the mixture of gases or the absorption of a gas in water as a \nphysical process, one in which forces of affinity played no part. To him, \ntherefore, the observed homogeneity of solutions was a problem, but \none which he thought he could solve if he could determine the relative \nsizes and weights of the various atomic particles in his experimental \nmixtures. It was to determine these sizes and weights that Dalton finally \nturned to chemistry, supposing from the start that, in the restricted \nrange of reactions that he took to be chemical, atoms could only \ncombine one-to-one or in some other simple whole-number ratio.24 That \nnatural assumption did enable him to determine the sizes and weights \nof elementary particles, but it also made the law of constant proportion \na tautology. For Dalton, any reaction in which the ingredients did not \nenter in fixed proportion was ipso facto not a purely chemical process. A \nlaw that experiment could not have established before Dalton\u2019s work, \nbecame, once that work was accepted, a constitutive principle that no \nsingle set of chemical measurements could have upset. As a result of \nwhat is perhaps our fullest example of a scientific revolution, the same \nchemical manipulations assumed a relationship to chemical \ngeneralization very different from the one they had had before. \n\nNeedless to say, Dalton\u2019s conclusions were widely attacked when first \nannounced. Berthollet, in particular, was never convinced. Considering \nthe nature of the issue, he need not have been. But to most chemists \nDalton\u2019s new paradigm proved convincing where Proust\u2019s had not been, \nfor it had implications far wider and more important than a new \ncriterion for distinguish- \n \n\n24 L.

If, for example, atoms could combine \nchemically only in simple whole-number ratios, then a re-examination \nof existing chemical data should disclose examples of multiple as well as \nof fixed proportions. Chemists stopped writing that the two oxides of, \nsay, carbon contained 56 per cent and 72 per cent of oxygen by weight; \ninstead they wrote that one weight of carbon would combine either with \n1.3 or with 2.6 weights of oxygen. When the results of old manipulations \nwere recorded in this way, a 2:1 ratio leaped to the eye; and this \noccurred in the analysis of many well-known reactions and of new ones \nbesides. In addition, Dalton\u2019s paradigm made it possible to assimilate \nRichter\u2019s work and to see its full generality. Also, it suggested new \nexperiments, particularly those of Gay-Lussac on combining volumes, \nand these yielded still other regularities, ones that chemists had not \npreviously dreamed of. What chemists took from Dalton was not new \nexperimental laws but a new way of practicing chemistry (he himself \ncalled it the \u201cnew system of chemical philosophy\u201d), and this proved so \nrapidly fruitful that only a few of the older chemists in France and \nBritain were able to resist it.25 As a result, chemists came to live in a \nworld where reactions behaved quite differently from the way they had \nbefore. \n\nAs all this went on, one other typical and very important change \noccurred. Here and there the very numerical data of chemistry began to \nshift. When Dalton first searched the chemical literature for data to \nsupport his physical theory, he found some records of reactions that \nfitted, but he can scarcely have avoided finding others that did not. \nProust\u2019s own measurements on the two oxides of copper yielded, for \nexample, an oxygen weight-ratio of 1.47:1 rather than the 2:1 demanded \nby the atomic theory; and Proust is just the man who might have been \nexpected to achieve the Daltonian ratio.26 He was, that is, a fine \n\n \n25 A.

But it is hard to make nature fit a \nparadigm. That is why the puzzles of normal science are so challenging \nand also why measurements undertaken without a paradigm so seldom \nlead to any conclusions at all. Chemists could not, therefore, simply \naccept Dalton\u2019s theory on the evidence, for much of that was still \nnegative. Instead, even after accepting the theory, they had still to beat \nnature into line, a process which, in the event, took almost another \ngeneration. When it was done, even the percentage composition of well-\nknown compounds was different. The data themselves had changed. \nThat is the last of the senses in which we may want to say that after a \nrevolution scientists work in a different world. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n135 \n\n\n\n \n \n \nXI. The Invisibility of Revolutions \n\n \nWe must still ask how scientific revolutions close. Before doing so, \n\nhowever, a last attempt to reinforce conviction about their existence and \nnature seems called for. I have so far tried to display revolutions by \nillustration, and the examples could be multiplied ad nauseam. But \nclearly, most of them, which were deliberately selected for their \nfamiliarity, have customarily been viewed not as revolutions but as \nadditions to scientific knowledge. That same view could equally well be \ntaken of any additional illustrations, and these Would probably be \nineffective. I suggest that there are excellent reasons why revolutions \nhave proved to be so nearly invisible. Both scientists and laymen take \nmuch of their image of creative scientific activity from an authoritative \nsource that systematically disguises\u2014partly for important functional \nreasons\u2014the existence and significance of scientific revolutions. Only \nwhen the nature of that authority is recognized and analyzed can one \nhope to make historical example fully effective. Furthermore, though \nthe point can be fully developed only in my concluding section, the \nanalysis now required will begin to indicate one of the aspects of \nscientific work that most clearly distinguishes it from every other \ncreative pursuit except perhaps theology. \nAs the source of authority, I have in mind principally textbooks of \nscience together with both the popularizations and the philosophical \nworks modeled on them. All three of these categories\u2014until recently no \nother significant sources of information about science have been \navailable except through the practice of research\u2014have one thing in \ncommon. They address themselves to an already articulated body of \nproblems, data, and theory, most often to the particular set of paradigms \nto which the scientific community is committed at the time they are \nwritten. Textbooks themselves aim to communicate the vocabulary and \nsyntax of a contemporary scientific language. Popularizations attempt to \ndescribe these same applications in a language  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n136 \n\n\n\nThe Invisibility of Revolutions \n \ncloser to that of everyday life. And philosophy of science, particularly \nthat of the English-speaking world, analyzes the logical structure of the \nsame completed body of scientific knowledge. Though a fuller treatment \nwould necessarily deal with the very real distinctions between these \nthree genres, it is their similarities that most concern us here. All three \nrecord the stable outcome of past revolutions and thus display the bases \nof the current normal-scientific tradition. To fulfill their function they \nneed not provide authentic information about the way in which those \nbases were first recognized and then embraced by the profession. In the \ncase of textbooks, at least, there are even good reasons why, in these \nmatters, they should be systematically misleading. \n\nWe noted in Section II that an increasing reliance on textbooks or \ntheir equivalent was an invariable concomitant of the emergence of a \nfirst paradigm in any field of science. The concluding section of this \nessay will argue that the domination of a mature science by such texts \nsignificantly differentiates its developmental pattern from that of other \nfields. For the moment let us simply take it for granted that, to an extent \nunprecedented in other fields, both the layman\u2019s and the practitioner\u2019s \nknowledge of science is based on textbooks and a few other types of \nliterature derived from them. Textbooks, however, being pedagogic \nvehicles for the perpetuation of normal science, have to be rewritten in \nwhole or in part whenever the language, problem-structure, or \nstandards of normal science change. In short, they have to be rewritten \nin the aftermath of each scientific revolution, and, once rewritten, they \ninevitably disguise not only the role but the very existence of the \nrevolutions that produced them. Unless he has personally experienced a \nrevolution in his own lifetime, the historical sense either of the working \nscientist or of the lay reader of textbook literature extends only to the \noutcome of the most recent revolutions in the field. \n\nTextbooks thus begin by truncating the scientist\u2019s sense of his \ndiscipline\u2019s history and then proceed to supply a substitute for what \nthey have eliminated. Characteristically, textbooks of science contain \njust a bit of history, either in an introductory \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n137 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nchapter or, more often, in scattered references to the great heroes of an \nearlier age. From such references both students and professionals come \nto feel like participants in a long-standing historical tradition. Yet the \ntextbook-derived tradition in which scientists come to sense their \nparticipation is one that, in fact, never existed. For reasons that are both \nobvious and highly functional, science textbooks (and too many of the \nolder histories of science) refer only to that part of the work of past \nscientists that can easily be viewed as contributions to the statement and \nsolution of the texts\u2019 paradigm problems. Partly by selection and partly \nby distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly represented as \nhaving worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance \nwith the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in \nscientific theory and method has made seem scientific. No wonder that \ntextbooks \u2018 and the historical tradition they imply have to be rewritten \nafter each scientific revolution. And no wonder that, as they are \nrewritten, science once again comes to seem largely cumulative. \nScientists are not, of course, the only group that tends to see its \ndiscipline\u2019s past developing linearly toward its present vantage. The \ntemptation to write history backward is both omnipresent and \nperennial. But scientists are more affected by the temptation to rewrite \nhistory, partly because the results of scientific research show no obvious \ndependence upon the historical context of the inquiry, and partly \nbecause, except during crisis and revolution, the scientist\u2019s \ncontemporary position seems so secure. More historical detail, whether \nof science\u2019s present or of its past, or more responsibility to the historical \ndetails that are presented, could only give artificial status to human \nidiosyncrasy, error, and confusion. Why dignify what science\u2019s best and \nmost persistent efforts have made it possible to discard? The \ndepreciation of historical fact is deeply, and probably functionally, \ningrained in the ideology of the scientific profession, the same \nprofession that places the highest of all values upon factual details of \nother sorts. Whitehead caught the unhistorical spirit of the scientific \ncommunity when he wrote, \u201cA science that hesitates to forget its \nfounders is lost.\u201d Yet he was not quite  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n138 \n\n\n\nThe Invisibility of Revolutions \n \nright, for the sciences, like other professional enterprises, do need their \nheroes and do preserve their names. Fortunately, instead of forgetting \nthese heroes, scientists have been able to forget or revise their works. \n\nThe result is a persistent tendency to make the history of science look \nlinear or cumulative, a tendency that even affects scientists looking back \nat their own research. For example, all three of Dalton\u2019s incompatible \naccounts of the development of his chemical atomism make it appear \nthat he was interested from an early date in just those chemical \nproblems of combining proportions that he was later famous for having \nsolved. Actually those problems seem only to have occurred to him with \ntheir solutions, and then not until his own creative work was very nearly \ncomplete.1 What all of Dalton\u2019s accounts omit are the revolutionary \neffects of applying to chemistry a set of questions and concepts \npreviously restricted to physics and meteorology. That is what Dalton \ndid, and the result was a reorientation toward the field, a reorientation \nthat taught chemists to ask new questions about and to draw new \nconclusions from old data. \n\nOr again, Newton wrote that Galileo had discovered that the constant \nforce of gravity produces a motion proportional to the square of the \ntime. In fact, Galileo\u2019s kinematic theorem does take that form when \nembedded in the matrix of Newton\u2019s own dynamical concepts. But \nGalileo said nothing of the sort. His discussion of falling bodies rarely \nalludes to forces, much less to a uniform gravitational force that causes \nbodies to fall.2 By crediting to Galileo the answer to a question that \nGalileo\u2019s paradigms did not permit to be asked, Newton\u2019s account hides \nthe effect of a small but revolutionary reformulation in the questions \nthat scientists asked about motion as well as in the \n \n\n1 L.

But it is just this sort of change in the \nformulation of questions and answers that accounts, far more than \nnovel empirical discoveries, for the transition from Aristotelian to \nGalilean and from Galilean to Newtonian dynamics. By disguising such \nchanges, the textbook tendency to make the development of science \nlinear hides a process that lies at the heart of the most significant \nepisodes of scientific development. \n\nThe preceding examples display, each within the context of a single \nrevolution, the beginnings of a reconstruction of history that is regularly \ncompleted by postrevolutionary science texts. But in that completion \nmore is involved than a multiplication of the historical misconstructions \nillustrated above. Those misconstructions render revolutions invisible; \nthe arrangement of the still visible material in science texts implies a \nprocess that, if it existed, would deny revolutions a function. Because \nthey aim quickly to acquaint the student with what the contemporary \nscientific community thinks it knows, textbooks treat the various \nexperiments, concepts, laws, and theories of the current normal science \nas separately and as nearly seriatim as possible. As pedagogy this \ntechnique of presentation is unexceptionable. But when combined with \nthe generally unhistorical air of science writing and with the occasional \nsystematic misconstructions discussed above, one strong impression is \noverwhelmingly likely to follow: science has reached its present state by \na series of individual discoveries and inventions that, when gathered \ntogether, constitute the modern body of technical knowledge. From the \nbeginning of the scientific enterprise, a textbook presentation implies, \nscientists have striven for the particular objectives that are embodied in \ntoday\u2019s paradigms. One by one, in a process often compared to the \naddition of bricks to a building, scientists have added another fact, \nconcept, law, or theory to the body of information supplied in the \ncontemporary science text. \nBut that is not the way a science develops. Many of the puzzles of \ncontemporary normal science did not exist until after the most recent \nscientific revolution. Very few of them can be  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n140 \n\n\n\nThe Invisibility of Revolutions \n \ntraced back to the historic beginning of the science within which they \nnow occur. Earlier generations pursued their own problems with their \nown instruments and their own canons of solution. Nor is it just the \nproblems that have changed. Rather the whole network of fact and \ntheory that the textbook paradigm fits to nature has shifted. Is the \nconstancy of chemical composition, for example, a mere fact of \nexperience that chemists could have discovered by experiment within \nany one of the worlds within which chemists have practiced? Or is it \nrather one element\u2014and an indubitable one, at that\u2014in a new fabric of \nassociated fact and theory that Dalton fitted to the earlier chemical \nexperience as a whole, changing that experience in the process? Or by \nthe same token, is the constant acceleration produced by a constant \nforce a mere fact that students of dynamics have always sought, or is it \nrather the answer to a question that first arose only within Newtonian \ntheory and that that theory could answer from the body of information \navailable before the question was asked? \n\nThese questions are here asked about what appear as the piecemeal-\ndiscovered facts of a textbook presentation. But obviously, they have \nimplications as well for what the text presents as theories. Those \ntheories, of course, do \u201cfit the facts,\u201d but only by transforming \npreviously accessible information into facts that, for the preceding \nparadigm, had not existed at all. And that means that theories too do \nnot evolve piecemeal to fit facts that were there all the time. Rather, \nthey emerge together with the facts they fit from a revolutionary \nreformulation of the preceding scientific tradition, a tradition within \nwhich the knowledge-mediated relationship between the scientist and \nnature was not quite the same. \n\nOne last example may clarify this account of the impact of textbook \npresentation upon our image of scientific development. Every \nelementary chemistry text must discuss the concept of a chemical \nelement. Almost always, when that notion is introduced, its origin is \nattributed to the seventeenth-century chemist, Robert Boyle, in whose \nSceptical Chymist the attentive reader will find a definition of \u2018element\u2019 \nquite close to that in \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n141 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nuse today. Reference to Boyle\u2019s contribution helps to make the neophyte \naware that chemistry did not begin with the sulfa drugs; in addition, it \ntells him that one of the scientist\u2019s traditional tasks is to invent concepts \nof this sort. As a part of the pedagogic arsenal that makes a man a \nscientist, the attribution is immensely successful. Nevertheless, it \nillustrates once more the pattern of historical mistakes that misleads \nboth students and laymen about the nature of the scientific enterprise. \n\nAccording to Boyle, who was quite right, his \u201cdefinition\u201d of an \nelement was no more than a paraphrase of a traditional chemical \nconcept; Boyle offered it only in order to argue that no such thing as a \nchemical element exists; as history, the textbook version of Boyle\u2019s \ncontribution is quite mistaken.3 That mistake, of course, is trivial, \nthough no more so than any other misrepresentation of data. What is \nnot trivial, however, is the impression of science fostered when this sort \nof mistake is first compounded and then built into the technical \nstructure of the text. Like \u2018time,\u2019 \u2018energy,\u2019 \u2018force,\u2019 or \u2018particle,\u2019 the concept \nof an element is the sort of textbook ingredient that is often not \ninvented or discovered at all. Boyle\u2019s definition, in particular, can be \ntraced back at least to Aristotle and forward through Lavoisier into \nmodern texts. Yet that is not to say that science has possessed the \nmodern concept of an element since antiquity. Verbal definitions like \nBoyle\u2019s have little scientific content when considered by themselves. \nThey are not full logical specifications of meaning (if there are such), \nbut more nearly pedagogic aids. The scientific concepts to which they \npoint gain full significance only when related, within a text or other \nsystematic presentation, to other scientific concepts, to manipulative \nprocedures, and to paradigm applications. It follows that concepts like \nthat of an element can scarcely be invented independent of context. \nFurthermore, given the context, they rarely require invention because \nthey are already at hand. Both Boyle and Lavoisier changed the \nchemical significance of \u2018element\u2019 in important ways. But they did not \ninvent the notion \n \n\n3 T. S.

Nor, as \nwe have seen, did Einstein have to invent or even explicitly redefine \n\u2018space\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019 in order to give them new meaning within the context \nof his work. \n\nWhat then was Boyle\u2019s historical function in that part of his work that \nincludes the famous \u201cdefinition\u201d? He was a leader of a scientific \nrevolution that, by changing the relation of \u2018element\u2019 to chemical \nmanipulation and chemical theory, transformed the notion into a tool \nquite different from what it had been before and transformed both \nchemistry and the chemist\u2019s world in the process.4 Other revolutions, \nincluding the one that centers around Lavoisier, were required to give \nthe concept its modern form and function. But Boyle provides a typical \nexample both of the process involved at each of these stages and of what \nhappens to that process when existing knowledge is embodied in a \ntextbook. More than any other single aspect of science, that pedagogic \nform has determined our image of the nature of science and of the role \nof discovery and invention in its advance. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4 Marie Boas, in her Robert Boyle and Seventeenth-Century Chemistry (Cambridge, 1958), \ndeals in many places with Boyle\u2019s positive contributions to the evolution of the concept \nof a chemical element. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n143 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\nXII. The Resolution of Revolutions \n \nThe textbooks we have just been discussing are produced only in the \n\naftermath of a scientific revolution. They are the bases for a new \ntradition of normal science. In taking up the question of their structure \nwe have clearly missed a step. What is the process by which a new \ncandidate for paradigm replaces its predecessor? Any new \ninterpretation of nature, whether a discovery or a theory, emerges first \nin the mind of one or a few individuals. It is they who first learn to see \nscience and the world differently, and their ability to make the \ntransition is facilitated by two circumstances that are not common to \nmost other members of their profession. Invariably their attention has \nbeen intensely concentrated upon the crisis-provoking problems; \nusually, in addition, they are men so young or so new to the crisis-ridden \nfield that practice has committed them less deeply than most of their \ncontemporaries to the world view and rules determined by the old \nparadigm. How are they able, what must they do, to convert the entire \nprofession or the relevant professional subgroup to their way of seeing \nscience and the world? What causes the group to abandon one tradition \nof normal research in favor of another? \nTo see the urgency of those questions, remember that they are the only \nreconstructions the historian can supply for the philosopher\u2019s inquiry \nabout the testing, verification, or falsification of established scientific \ntheories. In so far as he is engaged in normal science, the research \nworker is a solver of puzzles, not a tester of paradigms. Though he may, \ndining the search for a particular puzzle\u2019s solution, try out a number of \nalternative approaches, rejecting those that fail to yield the desired \nresult, he is not testing the paradigm when he does so. Instead he is like \nthe chess player who, with a problem stated and the board physically or \nmentally before him, tries out various alternative moves in the search \nfor a solution. These trial attempts, whether by the chess player or by \nthe scientist, are  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n144 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \ntrials only of themselves, not of the rules of the game. They are possible \nonly so long as the paradigm itself is taken for granted. Therefore, \nparadigm-testing occurs only after persistent failure to solve a \nnoteworthy puzzle has given rise to crisis. And even then it occurs only \nafter the sense of crisis has evoked an alternate candidate for paradigm. \nIn the sciences the testing situation never consists, as puzzle-solving \ndoes, simply in the comparison of a single paradigm with nature. \nInstead, testing occurs as part of the competition between two rival \nparadigms for the allegiance of the scientific community. \n\nClosely examined, this formulation displays unexpected and probably \nsignificant parallels to two of the most popular contemporary \nphilosophical theories about verification. Few philosophers of science \nstill seek absolute criteria for the verification of scientific theories. \nNoting that no theory can ever be exposed to all possible relevant tests, \nthey ask not whether a theory has been verified but rather about its \nprobability in the light of the evidence that actually exists. And to \nanswer that question one important school is driven to compare the \nability of different theories to explain the evidence at hand. That \ninsistence on comparing theories also characterizes the historical \nsituation in which a new theory is accepted. Very probably it points one \nof the directions in which future discussions of verification should \n\ngo. In their most usual forms, however, probabilistic verification \ntheories all have recourse to one or another of the pure or neutral \n\nobservation-languages discussed in Section X. One probabilistic theory \nasks that we compare the given scientific theory with all others that \nmight be imagined to fit the same collection of observed data. Another \ndemands the construction in imagination of all the tests that the given \nscientific theory might conceivably be asked to pass.1 Apparently some \nsuch construction is necessary for the computation of specific \nprobabilities, absolute or relative, and it is hard to see how such a \nconstruction can \n\n \n1 For a brief sketch of the main routes to probabilistic verification theories, see \nErnest Nagel, Principles of the Theory of Probability, Vol. I, No. 6, of International \nEncyclopedia of Unified Science, pp. 60-75. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n145 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\npossibly be achieved. If, as I have already urged, there can be no \nscientifically or empirically neutral system of language or concepts, then \nthe proposed construction of alternate tests and theories must proceed \nfrom within one or another paradigm-based tradition. Thus restricted it \nwould have no access to all possible experiences or to all possible \ntheories. As a result, probabilistic theories disguise the verification \nsituation as much as they illuminate it. Though that situation does, as \nthey insist, depend upon the comparison of theories and of much \nwidespread evidence, the theories and observations at issue are always \nclosely related to ones already in existence. Verification is like natural \nselection: it picks out the most viable among the actual alternatives in a \nparticular historical situation. Whether that choice is the best that could \nhave been made if still other alternatives had been available or if the \ndata had been of another sort is not a question that can usefully be \nasked. There are no tools to employ in seeking answers to it. \n\nA very different approach to this whole network of problems has \nbeen developed by Karl R. Popper who denies the existence of any \nverification procedures at all.2 Instead, he emphasizes the importance of \nfalsification, i.e., of the test that, because its outcome is negative, \nnecessitates the rejection of an established theory. Clearly, the role thus \nattributed to falsification is much like the one this essay assigns to \nanomalous experiences, i.e., to experiences that, by evoking crisis, \nprepare the way for a new theory. Nevertheless, anomalous experiences \nmay not be identified with falsifying ones. Indeed, I doubt that the latter \nexist. As has repeatedly been emphasized before, no theory ever solves \nall the puzzles with which it is confronted at a given time; nor are the \nsolutions already achieved often perfect. On the contrary, it is just the \nincompleteness and imperfection of the existing data-theory fit that, at \nany time, define many of the puzzles that characterize normal science. If \nany and every failure to fit were ground for theory rejection, all theories \nought to be rejected at all times. On the other hand, if only severe \nfailure \n \n\n2 K. R. Popper, The Logic of Scientific Discovery (New York, 1959), esp. chaps, i-iv. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n146 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nto fit justifies theory rejection, then the Popperians will require some \ncriterion of \u201cimprobability\u201d or of \u201cdegree of falsification.\u201d In developing \none they will almost certainly encounter the same network of difficulties \nthat has haunted the advocates of the various probabilistic verification \ntheories. \n\nMany of the preceding difficulties can be avoided by recognizing that \nboth of these prevalent and opposed views about the underlying logic of \nscientific inquiry have tried to compress two largely separate processes \ninto one. Popper\u2019s anomalous experience is important to science because \nit evokes competitors for an existing paradigm. But falsification, though \nit surely occurs, does not happen with, or simply because of, the \nemergence of an anomaly or falsifying instance. Instead, it is a \nsubsequent and separate process that might equally well be called \nverification since it consists in the triumph of a new paradigm over the \nold one. Furthermore, it is in that joint verification-falsification process \nthat the probabilist\u2019s comparison of theories plays a central role. Such a \ntwo-stage formulation has, I think, the virtue of great verisimilitude, and \nit may also enable us to begin explicating the role of agreement (or \ndisagreement) between fact and theory in the verification process. To \nthe historian, at least, it makes little sense to suggest that verification is \nestablishing the agreement of fact with theory. All historically \nsignificant theories have agreed with the facts, but only more or less. \nThere is no more precise answer to the question whether or how well an \nindividual theory fits the facts. But questions much like that can be \nasked when theories are taken collectively or even in pairs. It makes a \ngreat deal of sense to ask which of two actual and competing theories \nfits the facts better. Though neither Priestley\u2019s nor Lavoisier\u2019s theory, for \nexample, agreed precisely with existing observations, few \ncontemporaries hesitated more than a decade in concluding that \nLavoisier\u2019s theory provided the better fit of the two. \n\nThis formulation, however, makes the task of choosing between \nparadigms look both easier and more familiar than it is. If there were \nbut one set of scientific problems, one world within which to work on \nthem, and one set of standards for their \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n147 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nsolution, paradigm competition might be settled more or less routinely \nby some process like counting the number of problems solved by each. \nBut, in fact, these conditions are never met completely. The proponents \nof competing paradigms are always at least slightly at cross-purposes. \nNeither side will grant all the non-empirical assumptions that the other \nneeds in order to make its case. Like Proust and Berthollet arguing about \nthe composition of chemical compounds, they are bound partly to talk \nthrough each other. Though each may hope to convert the other to his \nway of seeing his science and its problems, neither may hope to prove \nhis case. The competition between paradigms is not the sort of battle \nthat can be resolved by proofs. We have already seen several reasons \nwhy the proponents of competing paradigms must fail to make complete \ncontact with each other\u2019s viewpoints. Collectively these reasons have \nbeen described as the incommensurability of the pre- and postrevo-\nlutionary normal-scientific traditions, and we need only recapitulate \nthem briefly here. In the first place, the proponents of competing \nparadigms will often disagree about the list of problems that any \ncandidate for paradigm must resolve. Their standards or their \ndefinitions of science are not the same. Must a theory of motion explain \nthe cause of the attractive forces between particles of matter or may it \nsimply note the existence of such forces? Newton\u2019s dynamics was widely \nrejected because, unlike both Aristotle\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s theories, it \nimplied the latter answer to the question. When Newton\u2019s theory had \nbeen accepted, a question was therefore banished from science. That \nquestion, however, was one that general relativity may proudly claim to \nhave solved. Or again, as disseminated in the nineteenth century, \nLavoisier\u2019s chemical theory inhibited chemists from asking why the \nmetals were so much alike, a question that phlogistic chemistry had \nboth asked and answered. The transition to Lavoisier\u2019s paradigm had, \nlike the transition to Newton\u2019s, meant a loss not only of a permissible \nquestion but of an achieved solution. That loss was not, however, \npermanent either. In the twentieth century questions about the qualities \nof \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n148 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nchemical substances have entered science again, together with some \nanswers to them. \n\nMore is involved, however, than the incommensurability of standards. \nSince new paradigms are born from old ones, they ordinarily \nincorporate much of the vocabulary and apparatus, both conceptual and \nmanipulative, that the traditional paradigm had previously employed. \nBut they seldom employ these borrowed elements in quite the \ntraditional way. Within the new paradigm, old terms, concepts, and \nexperiments fall into new relationships one with the other. The \ninevitable result is what we must call, though the term is not quite right, \na misunderstanding between the two competing schools. The laymen \nwho scoffed at Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity because space \ncould not be \u201ccurved\u201d\u2014it was not that sort of thing\u2014were not simply \nwrong or mistaken. Nor were the mathematicians, physicists, and \nphilosophers who tried to develop a Euclidean version of Einstein\u2019s \ntheory.3 What had previously been meant by space was necessarily flat, \nhomogeneous, isotropic, and unaffected by the presence of matter. If it \nhad not been, Newtonian physics would not have worked. To make the \ntransition to Einstein\u2019s universe, the whole conceptual web whose \nstrands are space, time, matter, force, and so on, had to be shifted and \nlaid down again on nature whole. Only men who had together \nundergone or failed to undergo that transformation would be able to \ndiscover precisely what they agreed or disagreed about. Communication \nacross the revolutionary divide is inevitably partial. Consider, for \nanother example, the men who called Copernicus mad because he \nproclaimed that the earth moved. They were not either just wrong or \nquite wrong. Part of what they meant by \u2018earth\u2019 was fixed position. Their \nearth, at least, could not be moved. Correspondingly, Copernicus\u2019 \ninnovation was not simply to move the earth. Rather, it was a whole new \nway of regarding the problems of physics and astronomy, \n\n \n3 For lay reactions to the concept of curved space, see Philipp Frank, Einstein, His \nLife and Times, trans, and ed.

On the \nother hand, once they had been made and understood, both Descartes \nand Huyghens could realize that the earth\u2019s motion was a question with \nno content for science.5 \n\nThese examples point to the third and most fundamental aspect of \nthe incommensurability of competing paradigms. In a sense that I am \nunable to explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms \npractice their trades in different worlds. One contains constrained \nbodies that fall slowly, the other pendulums that repeat their motions \nagain and again. In one, solutions are compounds, in the other mixtures. \nOne is embedded in a flat, the other in a curved, matrix of space. \nPracticing in different worlds, the two groups of scientists see different \nthings when they look from the same point in the same direction. Again, \nthat is not to say that they can see anything they please. Both are \nlooking at the world, and what they look at has not changed. But in \nsome areas they see different things, and they see them in different \nrelations one to the other. That is why a law that cannot even be \ndemonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem \nintuitively obvious to another. Equally, it is why, before they can hope to \ncommunicate fully, one group or the other must experience the \nconversion that we have been calling a paradigm shift. Just because it is \na transition between incommensurables, the transition between \ncompeting paradigms cannot be made a step at a time, forced by logic \nand neutral experience. Like the gestalt switch, it must occur all at once \n(though not necessarily in an instant) or not at all. \n\nHow, then, are scientists brought to make this transposition? Part of \nthe answer is that they are very often not. Copernican-ism made few \nconverts for almost a century after Copernicus\u2019 death. Newton\u2019s work \nwas not generally accepted, particularly on the Continent, for more than \nhalf a century after the Prin- \n\n \n4 T. S.

The difficulties of \nconversion have often been noted by scientists themselves. Darwin, in a \nparticularly perceptive passage at the end of his Origin of Species, wrote: \n\u201cAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this \nvolume \u2026, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists \nwhose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a \nlong course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. . . . \n[B]ut I look with confidence to the future,\u2014to young and rising \nnaturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with \nimpartiality.\u201d7 And Max Planck, surveying his own career in his Scientific \nAutobiography, sadly remarked that \u201ca new scientific truth does not \ntriumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but \nrather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows \nup that is familiar with it.\u201d8 \n\nThese facts and others like them are too commonly known to need \nfurther emphasis. But they do need re-evaluation. In the past they have \nmost often been taken to indicate that scientists, being only human, \ncannot always admit their errors, even when confronted with strict \nproof. I would argue, rather, that in these matters neither proof nor \nerror is at issue. The transfer of allegiance from paradigm to paradigm is \na conversion experience that cannot be forced. Lifelong resistance, \nparticularly from those whose productive careers have committed them \nto an older tradition of normal science, is not a violation of scientific \nstandards but an index to the nature of scientific research itself. The \nsource of resistance is the assurance that the older paradigm will \nultimately solve all its problems, that nature can be shoved \n\n \n6 I. B. Cohen, Franklin and Newton: An Inquiry into Speculative Newtonian \nExperimental Science and Franklin\u2019s Work in Electricity as an Example Thereof \n(Philadelphia, 1956), pp. 93-94. \n7 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species \u2026 (authorized edition from 6th \nEnglish ed.; New York, 1889), II, 295-96. \n8 Max Planck, Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers, trans.

Inevitably, at times of revolution, \nthat assurance seems stubborn and pigheaded as indeed it sometimes \nbecomes. But it is also something more. That same assurance is what \nmakes normal or puzzle-solving science possible. And it is only through \nnormal science that the professional community of scientists succeeds, \nfirst, in exploiting the potential scope and precision of the older \nparadigm and, then, in isolating the difficulty through the study of \nwhich a new paradigm may emerge. \n\nStill, to say that resistance is inevitable and legitimate, that paradigm \nchange cannot be justified by proof, is not to say that no arguments are \nrelevant or that scientists cannot be persuaded to change their minds. \nThough a generation is sometimes required to effect the change, \nscientific communities have again and again been converted to new \nparadigms. Furthermore, these conversions occur not despite the fact \nthat scientists are human but because they are. Though some scientists, \nparticularly the older and more experienced ones, may resist \nindefinitely, most of them can be reached in one way or another. \nConversions will occur a few at a time until, after the last holdouts have \ndied, the whole profession will again be practicing under a single, but \nnow a different, paradigm. We must therefore ask how conversion is \ninduced and how resisted. \n\nWhat sort of answer to that question may we expect? Just because it is \nasked about techniques of persuasion, or about argument and \ncounterargument in a situation in which there can be no proof, our \nquestion is a new one, demanding a sort of study that has not previously \nbeen undertaken. We shall have to settle for a very partial and \nimpressionistic survey. In addition, what has already been said combines \nwith the result of that survey to suggest that, when asked about \npersuasion rather than proof, the question of the nature of scientific \nargument has no single or uniform answer. Individual scientists \nembrace a new paradigm for all sorts of reasons and usually for several \nat once. Some of these reasons\u2014for example, the sun worship that \nhelped make Kepler a Copernican\u2014lie outside the apparent  \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n152 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nsphere of science entirely.9 Others must depend upon idiosyncrasies of \nautobiography and personality. Even the nationality or the prior \nreputation of the innovator and his teachers can sometimes play a \nsignificant role.10 Ultimately, therefore, we must learn to ask this \nquestion differently. Our concern will not then be with the arguments \nthat in fact convert one or another individual, but rather with the sort of \ncommunity that always sooner or later re-forms as a single group. That \nproblem, however, I postpone to the final section, examining meanwhile \nsome of the sorts of argument that prove particularly effective in the \nbattles over paradigm change. \n\nProbably the single most prevalent claim advanced by the proponents \nof a new paradigm is that they can solve the problems that have led the \nold one to a crisis. When it can legitimately be made, this claim is often \nthe most effective one possible. In the area for which it is advanced the \nparadigm is known to be in trouble. That trouble has repeatedly been \nexplored, and attempts to remove it have again and again proved vain. \n\u201cCrucial experiments\u201d\u2014those able to discriminate particularly sharply \nbetween the two paradigms\u2014have been recognized and attested before \nthe new paradigm was even invented. Copernicus thus claimed that he \nhad solved the long-vexing problem of the length of the calendar year, \nNewton that he had reconciled terrestrial and celestial mechanics, \nLavoisier that he had solved the problems of gas-identity and of weight \nrelations, and Einstein that he had made electrodynamics compatible \nwith a revised science of motion. \n\nClaims of this sort are particularly likely to succeed if the new \nparadigm displays a quantitative precision strikingly better than \n\n \n9 For the role of sun worship in Kepler\u2019s thought, see E. A. Burtt, The \nMetaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science (rev. ed.; New York, 1932), \npp. 44-49. \n10 For the role of reputation, consider the following: Lord Rayleigh, at a time \nwhen his reputation was established, submitted to the British Association a paper \non some paradoxes of electrodynamics. His name was inadvertently omitted \nwhen the paper was first sent, and the paper itself was at first rejected as the \nwork of some \u201cparadoxer.\u201d Shortly afterwards, with the author\u2019s name in place, \nthe paper was accepted with profuse apologies (R. J. Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh, \nJohn William Strutt, Third Baron Rayleigh [New York, 1924], p. 228). \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n153 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nits older competitor. The quantitative superiority of Kepler\u2019s Rudolphine \ntables to all those computed from the Ptolemaic theory was a major \nfactor in the conversion of astronomers to Copernicanism. Newton\u2019s \nsuccess in predicting quantitative astronomical observations was \nprobably the single most important reason for his theory\u2019s triumph over \nits more reasonable but uniformly qualitative competitors. And in this \ncentury the striking quantitative success of both Planck\u2019s radiation law \nand the Bohr atom quickly persuaded many physicists to adopt them \neven though, viewing physical science as a whole, both these \ncontributions created many more problems than they solved.11 \n\nThe claim to have solved the crisis-provoking problems is, however, \nrarely sufficient by itself. Nor can it always legitimately be made. In fact, \nCopernicus\u2019 theory was not more accurate than Ptolemy\u2019s and did not \nlead directly to any improvement in the calendar. Or again, the wave \ntheory of light was not, for some years after it was first announced, even \nas successful as its corpuscular rival in resolving the polarization effects \nthat were a principal cause of the optical crisis. Sometimes the looser \npractice that characterizes extraordinary research will produce a \ncandidate for paradigm that initially helps not at all with the problems \nthat have evoked crisis. When that occurs, evidence must be drawn from \nother parts of the field as it often is anyway. In those other areas \nparticularly persuasive arguments can be developed if the new \nparadigm permits the prediction of phenomena that had been entirely \nunsuspected while the old one prevailed. \n\nCopernicus\u2019 theory, for example, suggested that planets should be like \nthe earth, that Venus should show phases, and that the universe must be \nvastly larger than had previously been supposed. As a result, when sixty \nyears after his death the telescope suddenly displayed mountains on the \nmoon, the phases of Venus, and an immense number of previously \nunsuspected stars, \n\n \n11 For the problems created by the quantum theory, see F. Reiche, The \nQuantum Theory (London, 1922), chaps, ii, vi-ix. For the other examples \nin this paragraph, see the earlier references in this section. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n154 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nthose observations brought the new theory a great many converts, \nparticularly among non-astronomers.12 In the case of the wave theory, \none main source of professional conversions was even more dramatic. \nFrench resistance collapsed suddenly and relatively completely when \nFresnel was able to demonstrate the existence of a white spot at the \ncenter of the shadow of a circular disk. That was an effect that not even \nhe had anticipated but that Poisson, initially one of his opponents, had \nshown to be a necessary if absurd consequence of Fresnel\u2019s theory.13 \nBecause of their shock value and because they have so obviously not \nbeen \u201cbuilt into\u201d the new theory from the start, arguments like these \nprove especially persuasive. And sometimes that extra strength can be \nexploited even though the phenomenon in question had been observed \nlong before the theory that accounts for it was first introduced. Einstein, \nfor example, seems not to have anticipated that general relativity would \naccount with precision for the well-known anomaly in the motion of \nMercury\u2019s perihelion, and he experienced a corresponding triumph \nwhen it did so.14 \n\nAll the arguments for a new paradigm discussed so far have been \nbased upon the competitors\u2019 comparative ability to solve problems. To \nscientists those arguments are ordinarily the most significant and \npersuasive. The preceding examples should leave no doubt about the \nsource of their immense appeal. But, for reasons to which we shall \nshortly revert, they are neither individually nor collectively compelling. \nFortunately, there is also another sort of consideration that can lead \nscientists to reject an old paradigm in favor of a new. These are the \narguments, rarely made entirely explicit, that appeal to the individual\u2019s \nsense of the appropriate or the aesthetic\u2014the new theory is said to be \n\u201cneater,\u201d \u201cmore suitable,\u201d or \u201csimpler\u201d than the old.

By the time their \nfull aesthetic appeal can be developed, most of the community has been \npersuaded by other means. Nevertheless, the importance of aesthetic \nconsiderations can sometimes be decisive. Though they often attract \nonly a few scientists to a new theory, it is upon those few that its \nultimate triumph may depend. If they had not quickly taken it up for \nhighly individual reasons, the new candidate for paradigm might never \nhave been sufficiently developed to attract the allegiance of the scientific \ncommunity as a whole. \n\nTo see the reason for the importance of these more subjective and \naesthetic considerations, remember what a paradigm debate is about. \nWhen a new candidate for paradigm is first proposed, it has seldom \nsolved more than a few of the problems that confront it, and most of \nthose solutions are still far from perfect. Until Kepler, the Copernican \ntheory scarcely improved upon the predictions of planetary position \nmade by Ptolemy. When Lavoisier saw oxygen as \u201cthe air itself entire,\u201d \nhis new theory could cope not at all with the problems presented by the \nproliferation of new gases, a point that Priestley made with great success \nin his counterattack. Cases like Fresnel\u2019s white spot are extremely rare. \nOrdinarily, it is only much later, after the new paradigm has been \ndeveloped, accepted, and exploited that apparently decisive arguments\u2014\nthe Foucault pendulum to demonstrate the rotation of the earth or the \nFizeau experiment to show that light moves faster in air than in water\u2014\nare developed. Producing them is part of normal science, and their role \nis not in paradigm debate but in postrevolutionary texts. \nBefore those texts are written, while the debate goes on, the situation is \nvery different. Usually the opponents of a new paradigm can \nlegitimately claim that even in the area of crisis it is little superior to its \ntraditional rival. Of course, it handles some problems better, has \ndisclosed some new regularities. But the older paradigm can presumably \nbe articulated to meet these challenges as it has met others before. Both \nTycho Brahe\u2019s earth-centered astronomical system and the later versions \nof the  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n156 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nphlogiston theory were responses to challenges posed by a new \ncandidate for paradigm, and both were quite successful.15 In addition, \nthe defenders of traditional theory and procedure can almost always \npoint to problems that its new rival has not solved but that for their view \nare no problems at all. Until the discovery of the composition of water, \nthe combustion of hydrogen was a strong argument for the phlogiston \ntheory and against Lavoisier\u2019s. And after the oxygen theory had \ntriumphed, it could still not explain the preparation of a combustible gas \nfrom carbon, a phenomenon to which the phlogistonists had pointed as \nstrong support for their view.16 Even in the area of crisis, the balance of \nargument and counterargument can sometimes be very close indeed. \nAnd outside that area the balance will often decisively favor the \ntradition. Copernicus destroyed a time-honored explanation of \nterrestrial motion without replacing it; Newton did the same for an \nolder explanation of gravity, Lavoisier for the common properties of \nmetals, and so on. In short, if a new candidate for paradigm had to be \njudged from the start by hard-headed people who examined only \nrelative problem-solving ability, the sciences would experience very few \nmajor revolutions. Add the counterarguments generated by what we \npreviously called the incommensurability of paradigms, and the \nsciences might experience no revolutions at all. \n\nBut paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving \nability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. \nInstead, the issue is which paradigm should in the future guide research \non problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve \ncompletely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is \ncalled for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on \n\n \n15 For Brahe\u2019s system, which was geometrically entirely equivalent to \nCopernicus\u2019, see J.

The man who embraces a \nnew paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the \nevidence provided by problem-solving. He must, that is, have faith that \nthe new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that \nconfront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few. \nA decision of that kind can only be made on faith. \n\nThat is one of the reasons why prior crisis proves so important. \nScientists who have not experienced it will seldom renounce the hard \nevidence of problem-solving to follow what may easily prove and will be \nwidely regarded as a will-o\u2019-the-wisp. But crisis alone is not enough. \nThere must also be a basis, though it need be neither rational nor \nultimately correct, for faith in the particular candidate chosen. \nSomething must make at least a few scientists feel that the new proposal \nis on the right track, and sometimes it is only personal and inarticulate \naesthetic considerations that can do that. Men have been converted by \nthem at times when most of the articulable technical arguments pointed \nthe other way. When first introduced, neither Copernicus\u2019 astronomical \ntheory nor De Broglie\u2019s theory of matter had many other significant \ngrounds of appeal. Even today Einstein\u2019s general theory attracts men \nprincipally on aesthetic grounds, an appeal that few people outside of \nmathematics have been able to feel. \nThis is not to suggest that new paradigms triumph ultimately through \nsome mystical aesthetic. On the contrary, very few men desert a \ntradition for these reasons alone. Often those who do turn out to have \nbeen misled. But if a paradigm is ever to triumph it must gain some first \nsupporters, men who will develop it to the point where hardheaded \narguments can be produced and multiplied. And even those arguments, \nwhen they come, are not individually decisive. Because scientists are \nreasonable men, one or another argument will ultimately persuade \nmany of them. But there is no single argument that can or should \npersuade them all. Rather than a single group conversion, what occurs is \nan increasing shift in the distribution of professional allegiances.  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n158 \n\n\n\nThe Resolution of Revolutions \n \nAt the start a new candidate for paradigm may have few supporters, \n\nand on occasions the supporters\u2019 motives may be suspect. Nevertheless, \nif they are competent, they will improve it, explore its possibilities, and \nshow what it would be like to belong to the community guided by it. \nAnd as that goes on, if the paradigm is one destined to win its fight, the \nnumber and strength of the persuasive arguments in its favor will \nincrease. More scientists will then be converted, and the exploration of \nthe new paradigm will go on. Gradually the number of experiments, \ninstruments, articles, and books based upon the paradigm will multiply. \nStill more men, convinced of the new view\u2019s fruitfulness, will adopt the \nnew mode of practicing normal science, until at last only a few elderly \nhold-outs remain. And even they, we cannot say, are wrong. Though the \nhistorian can always find men\u2014Priestley, for instance\u2014who were \nunreasonable to resist for as long as they did, he will not find a point at \nwhich resistance becomes illogical or unscientific. At most he may wish \nto say that the man who continues to resist after his whole profession \nhas been converted has ipso facto ceased to be a scientist. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n159 \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXIII.   Progress through Revolutions \n\n \nThe preceding pages have carried my schematic description of \n\nscientific development as far as it can go in this essay. Nevertheless, they \ncannot quite provide a conclusion. If this description has at all caught \nthe essential structure of a science\u2019s continuing evolution, it will \nsimultaneously have posed a special problem: Why should the \nenterprise sketched above move steadily ahead in ways that, say, art, \npolitical theory, or philosophy does not? Why is progress a perquisite \nreserved almost exclusively for the activities we call science? The most \nusual answers to that question have been denied in the body of this \nessay. We must conclude it by asking whether substitutes can be found. \nNotice immediately that part of the question is entirely semantic. To a \nvery great extent the term \u2018science\u2019 is reserved for fields that do progress \nin obvious ways. Nowhere does this show more clearly than in the \nrecurrent debates about whether one or another of the contemporary \nsocial sciences is really a science. These debates have parallels in the \npre-paradigm periods of fields that are today unhesitatingly labeled \nscience. Their ostensible issue throughout is a definition of that vexing \nterm. Men argue that psychology, for example, is a science because it \npossesses such and such characteristics. Others counter that those \ncharacteristics are either unnecessary or not sufficient to make a field a \nscience. Often great energy is invested, great passion aroused, and the \noutsider is at a loss to know why. Can very much depend upon a \ndefinition of \u2018science\u2019? Can a definition tell a man whether he is a \nscientist or not? If so, why do not natural scientists or artists worry \nabout the definition of the term? Inevitably one suspects that the issue \nis more fundamental. Probably questions like the following are really \nbeing asked: Why does my field fail to move ahead in the way that, say, \nphysics does? What changes in technique or method or ideology would \nenable it to do so? These are not, however, questions that could respond \nto an agreement on definition. Furthermore, if prece- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n160 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \ndent from the natural sciences serves, they will cease to be a source of \nconcern not when a definition is found, but when the groups that now \ndoubt their own status achieve consensus about their past and present \naccomplishments. It may, for example, be significant that economists \nargue less about whether their field is a science than do practitioners of \nsome other fields of social science. Is that because economists know \nwhat science is? Or is it rather economics about which they agree? \n\nThat point has a converse that, though no longer simply semantic, \nmay help to display the inextricable connections between our notions of \nscience and of progress. For many centuries, both in antiquity and again \nin early modern Europe, painting was regarded as the cumulative \ndiscipline. During those years the artist\u2019s goal was assumed to be \nrepresentation. Critics and historians, like Pliny and Vasari, then \nrecorded with veneration the series of inventions from foreshortening \nthrough chiaroscuro that had made possible successively more perfect \nrepresentations of nature.1 But those are also the years, particularly \nduring the Renaissance, when little cleavage was felt between the \nsciences and the arts. Leonardo was only one of many men who passed \nfreely back and forth between fields that only later became categorically \ndistinct.2 Furthermore, even after that steady exchange had ceased, the \nterm \u2018art\u2019 continued to apply as much to technology and the crafts, \nwhich were also seen as progressive, as to painting and sculpture. Only \nwhen the latter unequivocally renounced representation as their goal \nand began to learn again from primitive models did the cleavage we now \ntake for granted assume anything like its present depth. And even today, \nto switch fields once more, part of our difficulty in seeing the profound \ndifferences between science and technology must relate to the fact that \nprogress is an obvious attribute of both fields. \n\n \n1 E.

There remains the problem of understanding why progress \nshould be so noteworthy a characteristic of an enterprise conducted \nwith the techniques and goals this essay has described. That question \nproves to be several in one, and we shall have to consider each of them \nseparately. In all cases but the last, however, their resolution will depend \nin part upon an inversion of our normal view of the relation between \nscientific activity and the community that practices it. We must learn to \nrecognize as causes what have ordinarily been taken to be effects. If we \ncan do that, the phrases \u2018scientific progress\u2019 and even \u2018scientific \nobjectivity\u2019 may come to seem in part redundant. In fact, one aspect of \nthe redundancy has just been illustrated. Does a field make progress \nbecause it is a science, or is it a science because it makes progress? \nAsk now why an enterprise like normal science should progress, and \nbegin by recalling a few of its most salient characteristics. Normally, the \nmembers of a mature scientific community work from a single paradigm \nor from a closely related set. Very rarely do different scientific \ncommunities investigate the same problems. In those exceptional cases \nthe groups hold several major paradigms in common. Viewed from \nwithin any single community, however, whether of scientists or of non-\nscientists, the result of successful creative work is progress. How could it \npossibly be anything else? We have, for example, just noted that while \nartists aimed at representation as their goal, both critics and historians \nchronicled the progress of the apparently united group. Other creative \nfields display progress of the same sort. The theologian who articulates \ndogma or the philosopher who refines the Kantian imperatives \ncontributes to progress, if only to that of the group that shares his \npremises. No creative school recognizes a category of work that is, on \nthe one hand, a creative success, but is not, on the other, an addition to \nthe collective achievement of the group. If we doubt, as many do, that \nnon-scientific fields make progress, that cannot be because individual \nschools make none. Rather, it must be because there are always  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n162 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \ncompeting schools, each of which constantly questions the very \nfoundations of the others. The man who argues that philosophy, for \nexample, has made no progress emphasizes that there are still \nAristotelians, not that Aristotelianism has failed to progress. \n\nThese doubts about progress arise, however, in the sciences too. \nThroughout the pre-paradigm period when there is a multiplicity of \ncompeting schools, evidence of progress, except within schools, is very \nhard to find. This is the period described in Section II as one during \nwhich individuals practice science, but in which the results of their \nenterprise do not add up to science as we know it. And again, during \nperiods of revolution when the fundamental tenets of a field are once \nmore at issue, doubts are repeatedly expressed about the very possibility \nof continued progress if one or another of the opposed paradigms is \nadopted. Those who rejected Newtonianism proclaimed that its reliance \nupon innate forces would return science to the Dark Ages. Those who \nopposed Lavoisier\u2019s chemistry held that the rejection of chemical \n\u201cprinciples\u201d in favor of laboratory elements was the rejection of \nachieved chemical explanation by those who would take refuge in a \nmere name. A similar, though more moderately expressed, feeling seems \nto underlie the opposition of Einstein, Bohm, and others, to the \ndominant probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. In short, \nit is only during periods of normal science that progress seems both \nobvious and assured. During those periods, however, the scientific \ncommunity could view the fruits of its work in no other way. \n\nWith respect to normal science, then, part of the answer to the \nproblem of progress lies simply in the eye of the beholder. Scientific \nprogress is not different in kind from progress in other fields, but the \nabsence at most times of competing schools that question each other\u2019s \naims and standards makes the progress of a normal-scientific \ncommunity far easier to see. That, however, is only part of the answer \nand by no means the most important part. We have, for example, \nalready noted that once the reception of a common paradigm has freed \nthe scientific community from the need constantly to re-examine its first \nprinciples, the members of that community can concentrate exclusively \nupon \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n163 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nthe subtlest and most esoteric of the phenomena that concern it. \nInevitably, that does increase both the effectiveness and the efficiency \nwith which the group as a whole solves new problems. Other aspects of \nprofessional life in the sciences enhance this very special efficiency still \nfurther. \n\nSome of these are consequences of the unparalleled insulation of \nmature scientific communities from the demands of the laity and of \neveryday life. That insulation has never been complete\u2014 we are now \ndiscussing matters of degree. Nevertheless, there are no other \nprofessional communities in which individual creative work is so \nexclusively addressed to and evaluated by other members of the \nprofession. The most esoteric of poets or the most abstract of \ntheologians is far more concerned than the scientist with lay \napprobation of his creative work, though he may be even less concerned \nwith approbation in general. That difference proves consequential. Just \nbecause he is working only for an audience of colleagues, an audience \nthat shares his own values and beliefs, the scientist can take a single set \nof standards for granted. He need not worry about what some other \ngroup or school will think and can therefore dispose of one problem and \nget on to the next more quickly than those who work for a more \nheterodox group. Even more important, the insulation of the scientific \ncommunity from society permits the individual scientist to concentrate \nhis attention upon problems that he has good reason to believe he will \nbe able to solve. Unlike the engineer, and many doctors, and most \ntheologians, the scientist need not choose problems because they \nurgently need solution and without regard for the tools available to solve \nthem. In this respect, also, the contrast between natural scientists and \nmany social scientists proves instructive. The latter often tend, as the \nformer almost never do, to defend their choice of a research problem\u2014 \ne.g., the effects of racial discrimination or the causes of the business \ncycle\u2014chiefly in terms of the social importance of achieving a solution. \nWhich group would one then expect to solve problems at a more rapid \nrate? \n\nThe effects of insulation from the larger society are greatly intensified \nby another characteristic of the professional scientific  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n164 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \ncommunity, the nature of its educational initiation. In music, the \ngraphic arts, and literature, the practitioner gains his education by \nexposure to the works of other artists, principally earlier artists. \nTextbooks, except compendia of or handbooks to original creations, have \nonly a secondary role. In history, philosophy, and the social sciences, \ntextbook literature has a greater significance. But even in these fields the \nelementary college course employs parallel readings in original sources, \nsome of them the \u201cclassics\u201d of the field, others the contemporary \nresearch reports that practitioners write for each other. As a result, the \nstudent in any one of these disciplines is constantly made aware of the \nimmense variety of problems that the members of his future group \nhave, in the course of time, attempted to solve. Even more important, he \nhas constantly before him a number of competing and \nincommensurable solutions to these problems, solutions that he must \nultimately evaluate for himself. \n\nContrast this situation with that in at least the contemporary natural \nsciences. In these fields the student relies mainly on textbooks until, in \nhis third or fourth year of graduate work, he begins his own research. \nMany science curricula do not ask even graduate students to read in \nworks not written specially for students. The few that do assign \nsupplementary reading in research papers and monographs restrict \nsuch assignments to the most advanced courses and to materials that \ntake up more or less where the available texts leave off. Until the very \nlast stages in the education of a scientist, textbooks are systematically \nsubstituted for the creative scientific literature that made them possible. \nGiven the confidence in their paradigms, which makes this educational \ntechnique possible, few scientists would wish to change it. Why, after all, \nshould the student of physics, for example, read the works of Newton, \nFaraday, Einstein, or Schr\u00f6dinger, when everything he needs to know \nabout these works is recapitulated in a far briefer, more precise, and \nmore systematic form in a number of up-to-date textbooks? \n\nWithout wishing to defend the excessive lengths to which this type of \neducation has occasionally been carried, one cannot help but notice that \nin general it has been immensely effective. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n165 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nOf course, it is a narrow and rigid education, probably more so than \nany other except perhaps in orthodox theology. But for normal-scientific \nwork, for puzzle-solving within the tradition that the textbooks define, \nthe scientist is almost perfectly equipped. Furthermore, he is well \nequipped for another task as well\u2014the generation through normal \nscience of significant crises. When they arise, the scientist is not, of \ncourse, equally well prepared. Even though prolonged crises are \nprobably reflected in less rigid educational practice, scientific training is \nnot well designed to produce the man who will easily discover a fresh \napproach. But so long as somebody appears with a new candidate for \nparadigm\u2014usually a young man or one new to the field\u2014the loss due to \nrigidity accrues only to the individual. Given a generation in which to \neffect the change, individual rigidity is compatible with a community \nthat can switch from paradigm to paradigm when the occasion \ndemands. Particularly, it is compatible when that very rigidity provides \nthe community with a sensitive indicator that something has gone \nwrong. \n\nIn its normal state, then, a scientific community is an immensely \nefficient instrument for solving the problems or puzzles that its \nparadigms define. Furthermore, the result of solving those problems \nmust inevitably be progress. There is no problem here. Seeing that \nmuch, however, only highlights the second main part of the problem of \nprogress in the sciences. Let us therefore turn to it and ask about \nprogress through extraordinary science. Why should progress also be \nthe apparently universal concomitant of scientific revolutions? Once \nagain, there is much to be learned by asking what else the result of a \nrevolution could be. Revolutions close with a total victory for one of the \ntwo opposing camps. Will that group ever say that the result of its \nvictory has been something less than progress? That would be rather \nlike admitting that they had been wrong and their opponents right. To \nthem, at least, the outcome of revolution must be progress, and they are \nin an excellent position to make certain that future members of their \ncommunity will see past history in the same way. Section XI described in \ndetail the tech- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n166 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \nniques by which this is accomplished, and we have just recurred to a \nclosely related aspect of professional scientific life. When it repudiates a \npast paradigm, a scientific community simultaneously renounces, as a fit \nsubject for professional scrutiny, most of the books and articles in which \nthat paradigm had been embodied. Scientific education makes use of no \nequivalent for the art museum or the library of classics, and the result is \na sometimes drastic distortion in the scientist\u2019s perception of his \ndiscipline\u2019s past. More than the practitioners of other creative fields, he \ncomes to see it as leading in a straight line to the discipline\u2019s present \nvantage. In short, he comes to see it as progress. No alternative is \navailable to him while he remains in the field. \n\nInevitably those remarks will suggest that the member of a mature \nscientific community is, like the typical character of Orwell\u2019s 1984, the \nvictim of a history rewritten by the powers that be. Furthermore, that \nsuggestion is not altogether inappropriate. There are losses as well as \ngains in scientific revolutions, and scientists tend to be peculiarly blind \nto the former.3 On the other hand, no explanation of progress through \nrevolutions may stop at this point. To do so would be to imply that in the \nsciences might makes right, a formulation which would again not be \nentirely wrong if it did not suppress the nature of the process and of the \nauthority by which the choice between paradigms is made. If authority \nalone, and particularly if nonprofessional authority, were the arbiter of \nparadigm debates, the outcome of those debates might still be \nrevolution, but it would not be scientific revolution. The very existence \nof science depends upon vesting the power to choose between \nparadigms in the members of a special kind of community. Just how \nspecial that community must be if science is to survive and grow may be \nindicated by the very tenuousness of humanity\u2019s hold on the scientific \nenterprise. Every civilization of which we have records \n \n\n3 Historians of science often encounter this blindness in a particularly striking form. The \ngroup of students who come to them from the sciences is very often the most rewarding \ngroup they teach. But it is also usually the most frustrating at the start. Because science \nstudents \u201cknow the right answers,\u201d it is particularly difficult to make them analyze an \nolder science in its own terms. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n167 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nhas possessed a technology, an art, a religion, a political system, laws, \nand so on. In many cases those facets of civilization have been as \ndeveloped as our own. But only the civilizations that descend from \nHellenic Greece have possessed more than the most rudimentary \nscience. The bulk of scientific knowledge is a product of Europe in the \nlast four centuries. No other place and time has supported the very \nspecial communities from which scientific productivity comes. \n\nWhat are the essential characteristics of these communities? \nObviously, they need vastly more study. In this area only the most \ntentative generalizations are possible. Nevertheless, a number of \nrequisites for membership in a professional scientific group must \nalready be strikingly clear. The scientist must, for example, be \nconcerned to solve problems about the behavior of nature. In addition, \nthough his concern with nature may be global in its extent, the \nproblems on which he works must be problems of detail. More \nimportant, the solutions that satisfy him may not be merely personal \nbut must instead be accepted as solutions by many. The group that \nshares them may not, however, be drawn at random from society as a \nwhole, but is rather the well-defined community of the scientist\u2019s \nprofessional compeers. One of the strongest, if still unwritten, rules of \nscientific life is the prohibition of appeals to heads of state or to the \npopulace at large in matters scientific. Recognition of the existence of a \nuniquely competent professional group and acceptance of its role as the \nexclusive arbiter of professional achievement has further implications. \nThe group\u2019s members, as individuals and by virtue of their shared \ntraining and experience, must be seen as the sole possessors of the rules \nof the game or of some equivalent basis for unequivocal judgments. To \ndoubt that they shared some such basis for evaluations would be to \nadmit the existence of incompatible standards of scientific achievement. \nThat admission would inevitably raise the question whether truth in the \nsciences can be one. \n\nThis small list of characteristics common to scientific communities \nhas been drawn entirely from the practice of normal science, and it \nshould have been. That is the activity for which  \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n168 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \nthe scientist is ordinarily trained. Note, however, that despite its small \nsize the list is already sufficient to set such communities apart from all \nother professional groups. And note, in addition, that despite its source \nin normal science the list accounts for many special features of the \ngroup\u2019s response during revolutions and particularly during paradigm \ndebates. We have already observed that a group of this sort must see a \nparadigm change as progress. Now we may recognize that the \nperception is, in important respects, self-fulfilling. The scientific \ncommunity is a supremely efficient instrument for maximizing the \nnumber and precision of the problem solved through paradigm change. \n\nBecause the unit of scientific achievement is the solved problem and \nbecause the group knows well which problems have already been solved, \nfew scientists will easily be persuaded to adopt a viewpoint that again \nopens to question many problems that had previously been solved. \nNature itself must first undermine professional security by making prior \nachievements seem problematic. Furthermore, even when that has \noccurred and a new candidate for paradigm has been evoked, scientists \nwill be reluctant to embrace it unless convinced that two all-important \nconditions are being met. First, the new candidate must seem to resolve \nsome outstanding and generally recognized problem that can be met in \nno other way. Second, the new paradigm must promise to preserve a \nrelatively large part of the concrete problem-solving ability that has \naccrued to science through its predecessors. Novelty for its own sake is \nnot a desideratum in the sciences as it is in so many other creative fields. \nAs a result, though new paradigms seldom or never possess all the \ncapabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve a great deal of \nthe most concrete parts of past achievement and they always permit \nadditional concrete problem-solutions besides. \n\nTo say this much is not to suggest that the ability to solve problems is \neither the unique or an unequivocal basis for paradigm choice. We have \nalready noted many reasons why there can be no criterion of that sort. \nBut it does suggest that a community of scientific specialists will do all \nthat it can to ensure the continuing growth of the assembled data that it \ncan treat \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n169 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nwith precision and detail. In the process the community will sustain \nlosses. Often some old problems must be banished. Frequently, in \naddition, revolution narrows the scope of the community\u2019s professional \nconcerns, increases the extent of its specialization, and attenuates its \ncommunication with other groups, both scientific and lay. Though \nscience surely grows in depth, it may not grow in breadth as well. If it \ndoes so, that breadth is manifest mainly in the proliferation of scientific \nspecialties, not in the scope of any single specialty alone. Yet despite \nthese and other losses to the individual communities, the nature of such \ncommunities provides a virtual guarantee that both the list of problems \nsolved by science and the precision of individual problem-solutions will \ngrow and grow. At least, the nature of the community provides such a \nguarantee if there is any way at all in which it can be provided. What \nbetter criterion than the decision of the scientific group could there be? \n\nThese last paragraphs point the directions in which I believe a more \nrefined solution of the problem of progress in the sciences must be \nsought. Perhaps they indicate that scientific progress is not quite what \nwe had taken it to be. But they simultaneously show that a sort of \nprogress will inevitably characterize the scientific enterprise so long as \nsuch an enterprise survives. In the sciences there need not be progress \nof another sort. We may, to be more precise, have to relinquish the \nnotion, explicit or implicit, that changes of paradigm carry scientists and \nthose who learn from them closer and closer to the truth. \n\nIt is now time to notice that until the last very few pages the term \n\u2018truth\u2019 had entered this essay only in a quotation from Francis Bacon. \nAnd even in those pages it entered only as a source for the scientist\u2019s \nconviction that incompatible rules for doing science cannot coexist \nexcept during revolutions when the profession\u2019s main task is to \neliminate all sets but one. The developmental process described in this \nessay has been a process of evolution from primitive beginnings\u2014a \nprocess whose successive stages are characterized by an increasingly \ndetailed and refined understanding of nature. But nothing that has \n\u201cbeen or will be said makes it a process of evolution toward any- \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n170 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \nthing. Inevitably that lacuna will have disturbed many readers. We are \nall deeply accustomed to seeing science as the one enterprise that draws \nconstantly nearer to some goal set by nature in advance. \n\nBut need there be any such goal? Can we not account for both \nscience\u2019s existence and its success in terms of evolution from the \ncommunity\u2019s state of knowledge at any given time? Does it really help to \nimagine that there is some one full, objective, true account of nature \nand that the proper measure of scientific achievement is the extent to \nwhich it brings us closer to that ultimate goal? If we can learn to \nsubstitute evolution-from-what-we-do-know for evolution-toward-what-\nwe-wish-to-know, a number of vexing problems may vanish in the \nprocess. Somewhere in this maze, for example, must lie the problem of \ninduction. \n\nI cannot yet specify in any detail the consequences of this alternate \nview of scientific advance. But it helps to recognize that the conceptual \ntransposition here recommended is very close to one that the West \nundertook just a century ago. It is particularly helpful because in both \ncases the main obstacle to transposition is the same. When Darwin first \npublished his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859, what \nmost bothered many professionals was neither the notion of species \nchange nor the possible descent of man from apes. The evidence \npointing to evolution, including the evolution of man, had been \naccumulating for decades, and the idea of evolution had been suggested \nand widely disseminated before. Though evolution, as such, did \nencounter resistance, particularly from some religious groups, it was by \nno means the greatest of the difficulties the Darwinians faced. That \ndifficulty stemmed from an idea that was more nearly Darwin\u2019s own. All \nthe well-known pre-Darwinian evolutionary theories\u2014those of Lamarck, \nChambers, Spencer, and the German Naturphilosophen\u2014had taken \nevolution to be a goal-directed process. The \u201cidea\u201d of man and of the \ncontemporary flora and fauna was thought to have been present from \nthe first creation of life, perhaps in the mind of God. That idea or plan \nhad provided the direction and the guiding force to \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n171 \n\n\n\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions \n \n\nthe entire evolutionary process. Each new stage of evolutionary \ndevelopment was a more perfect realization of a plan that had been \npresent from the start.4 \n\nFor many men the abolition of that teleological kind of evolution was \nthe most significant and least palatable of Darwin\u2019s suggestions.5 The \nOrigin of Species recognized no goal set either by God or nature. Instead, \nnatural selection, operating in the given environment and with the \nactual organisms presently at hand, was responsible for the gradual but \nsteady emergence of more elaborate, further articulated, and vastly \nmore specialized organisms. Even such marvelously adapted organs as \nthe eye and hand of man\u2014organs whose design had previously provided \npowerful arguments for the existence of a supreme artificer and an \nadvance plan\u2014were products of a process that moved steadily from \nprimitive beginnings but toward no goal. The belief that natural \nselection, resulting from mere competition between organisms for \nsurvival, could have produced man together with the higher animals \nand plants was the most difficult and disturbing aspect of Darwin\u2019s \ntheory. What could \u2018evolution,\u2019 \u2018development,\u2019 and \u2018progress\u2019 mean in \nthe absence of a specified goal? To many people, such terms suddenly \nseemed self-contradictory. \n\nThe analogy that relates the evolution of organisms to the evolution \nof scientific ideas can easily be pushed too far. But with respect to the \nissues of this closing section it is very nearly perfect. The process \ndescribed in Section XII as the resolution of revolutions is the selection \nby conflict within the scientific community of the fittest way to practice \nfuture science. The net result of a sequence of such revolutionary \nselections, separated by periods of normal research, is the wonderfully \nadapted set of instruments we call modern scientific knowledge. \nSuccessive stages in that developmental process are marked by an \nincrease in articulation and specialization. And the entire process may \nhave occurred, as we now suppose biological evolution did, \n \n\n4 Loren Eiseley, Darwin\u2019s Century: Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It (New \nYork, 1958), chaps, ii, iv-v. \n5 For a particularly acute account of one prominent Darwinian\u2019s struggle with this \nproblem, see A. Hunter Dupree, Asa Gray, 1810-1888 (Cambridge, Mass., 1959), \npp. 295-306, 355-83. \n \nVol. II, No. 2 \n172 \n\n\n\nProgress through Revolutions \n \nwithout benefit of a set goal, a permanent fixed scientific truth, of which \neach stage in the development of scientific knowledge is a better \nexemplar. \n\nAnyone who has followed the argument this far will nevertheless feel \nthe need to ask why the evolutionary process should work. What must \nnature, including man, be like in order that science be possible at all? \nWhy should scientific communities be able to reach a firm consensus \nunattainable in other fields? Why should consensus endure across one \nparadigm change after another? And why should paradigm change \ninvariably produce an instrument more perfect in any sense than those \nknown before? From one point of view those questions, excepting the \nfirst, have already been answered. But from another they are as open as \nthey were when this essay began. It is not only the scientific community \nthat must be special. The world of which that community is a part must \nalso possess quite special characteristics, and we are no closer than we \nwere at the start to knowing what these must be. That problem\u2014What \nmust the world be like in order that man may know it?\u2014was not, \nhowever, created by this essay. On the contrary, it is as old as science \nitself, and it remains unanswered. But it need not be answered in this \nplace. Any conception of nature compatible with the growth of science \nby proof is compatible with the evolutionary view of science developed \nhere. Since this view is also compatible with close observation of \nscientific life, there are strong arguments for employing it in attempts to \nsolve the host of problems that still remain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVol. II, No. 2  \n173 \n\n\n\nPostscript\u20141969 \n \nIt has now been almost seven years since this book was first \n\npublished.1 In the interim both the response of critics and my own \nfurther work have increased my understanding of a number of the \nissues it raises. On fundamentals my viewpoint is very nearly \nunchanged, but I now recognize aspects of its initial formulation that \ncreate gratuitous difficulties and misunderstandings. Since some of \nthose misunderstandings have been my own, their elimination enables \nme to gain ground that should ultimately provide the basis for a new \nversion of the book.2 Meanwhile, I welcome the chance to sketch needed \nrevisions, to comment on some reiterated criticisms, and to suggest \ndirections in which my own thought is presently developing.3 \n\nSeveral of the key difficulties of my original text cluster about the \nconcept of a paradigm, and my discussion begins with them.4 In the \nsubsection that follows at once, I suggest the desirability of \ndisentangling that concept from the notion of a scientific community, \nindicate how this may be done, and discuss some signifi- \n\n \n1 This postscript was first prepared at the suggestion of my onetime student and \nlongtime friend, Dr. Shigeru Nakayama of the University of Tokyo, for inclusion \nin his Japanese translation of this book. I am grateful to him for the idea, for his \npatience in awaiting its fruition, and for permission to include the result in the \nEnglish language edition. \n2 For this edition I have attempted no systematic rewriting, restricting \nalterations to a few typographical errors plus two passages which contained \nisolable errors. One of these is the description of the role of Newton\u2019s Principia in \nthe development of eighteenth-century mechanics on pp. 30-33, above. The other \nconcerns the response to crises on p. 84. \n3 Other indications will be found in two recent essays of mine: \u201cReflection on My \nCritics,\u201d in Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave (eds.), Criticism and the Growth of \nKnowledge (Cambridge, 1970); and \u201cSecond Thoughts on Paradigms,\u201d in Frederick \nSuppe (ed.), The Structure of Scientific Theories (Urbana, Ill., 1970 or 1971), both \ncurrently in press. I shall cite the first of these essays below as \u201cReflections\u201d and \nthe volume in which it appears as Growth of Knowledge; the second essay will be \nreferred to as \u201cSecond Thoughts.\u201d \n4 For particularly cogent criticism of my initial presentation of paradigms see: \nMargaret Masterman, \u201cThe Nature of a Paradigm,\u201d in Growth of Knowledge; and \nDudley Shapere, \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\u201d Philosophical Review, \nLXXIII (1964), 383-94. \n \n174 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\ncant consequences of the resulting analytic separation. Next I consider \nwhat occurs when paradigms are sought by examining the behavior of \nthe members of a previously determined scientific community. That \nprocedure quickly discloses that in much of the book the term \n\u2018paradigm\u2019 is used in two different senses. On the one hand, it stands for \nthe entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared \nby the members of a given community. On the other, it denotes one sort \nof element in that constellation, the concrete puzzle-solutions which, \nemployed as models or examples, can replace explicit rules as a basis for \nthe solution of the remaining puzzles of normal science. The first sense \nof the term, call it the sociological, is the subject of Subsection 2, below; \nSubsection 3 is devoted to paradigms as exemplary past achievements. \n\nPhilosophically, at least, this second sense of \u2018paradigm\u2019 is the deeper \nof the two, and the claims I have made in its name are the main sources \nfor the controversies and misunderstandings that the book has evoked, \nparticularly for the charge that I make of science a subjective and \nirrational enterprise. These issues are considered in Subsections 4 and 5. \nThe first argues that terms like \u2018subjective\u2019 and \u2018intuitive\u2019 cannot \nappropriately be applied to the components of knowledge that I have \ndescribed as tacitly embedded in shared examples. Though such \nknowledge is not, without essential change, subject to paraphrase in \nterms of rules and criteria, it is nevertheless systematic, time tested, and \nin some sense corrigible. Subsection 5 applies that argument to the \nproblem of choice between two incompatible theories, urging in brief \nconclusion that men who hold incommensurable viewpoints be thought \nof as members of different language communities and that their \ncommunication problems be analyzed as problems of translation. Three \nresidual issues are discussed in the concluding Subsections, 6 and 7. The \nfirst considers the charge that the view of science developed in this book \nis through-and-through relativistic. The second begins by inquiring \nwhether my argument really suffers, as has been said, from a confusion \nbetween the descriptive and the normative modes; it concludes with \nbrief remarks on a topic deserving a separate \n \n175 \n\n \n \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nessay: the extent to which the book\u2019s main theses may legitimately be \napplied to fields other than science. \n\n \n1. Paradigms and Community Structure \n\n \nThe term \u2018paradigm\u2019 enters the preceding pages early, and its manner \n\nof entry is intrinsically circular. A paradigm is what the members of a \nscientific community share, and, conversely, a scientific community \nconsists of men who share a paradigm. Not all circularities are vicious (I \nshall defend an argument of similar structure late in this postscript), but \nthis one is a source of real difficulties. Scientific communities can and \nshould be isolated without prior recourse to paradigms; the latter can \nthen be discovered by scrutinizing the behavior of a given community\u2019s \nmembers. If this book were being rewritten, it would therefore open \nwith a discussion of the community structure of science, a topic that has \nrecently become a significant subject of sociological research and that \nhistorians of science are also beginning to take seriously. Preliminary \nresults, many of them still unpublished, suggest that the empirical \ntechniques required for its exploration are non-trivial, but some are in \nhand and others are sure to be developed.5 Most practicing scientists \nrespond at once to questions about their community affiliations, taking \nfor granted that responsibility for the various current specialties is \ndistributed among groups of at least roughly determinate membership. I \nshall therefore here assume that more systematic means for their \nidentification will be found. Instead of presenting preliminary research \nresults, let me briefly articulate the intuitive notion of community that \nunderlies much in the earlier chapters of this book. It is a notion now \nwidely shared by scientists, sociologists, and a number of historians of \nscience. \n\n \n5 W. O. Hagstrom, The Scientific Community (New York, 1965), chaps. iv and v; D. \nJ.

Beaver, \u201cCollaboration in an Invisible College,\u201d American \nPsychologist, XXI (1966), 1011-18; Diana Crane, \u201cSocial Structure in a Group of \nScientists: A Test of the \u2018Invisible College\u2019 Hypothesis,\u201d American Sociological \nReview, XXXIV (1969), 335-52; N.

To an extent unparalleled in most other fields, they \nhave undergone similar educations and professional initiations; in the \nprocess they have absorbed the same technical literature and drawn \nmany of the same lessons from it. Usually the boundaries of that \nstandard literature mark the limits of a scientific subject matter, and \neach community ordinarily has a subject matter of its own. There are \nschools in the sciences, communities, that is, which approach the same \nsubject from incompatible viewpoints. But they are far rarer there than \nin other fields; they are always in competition; and their competition is \nusually quickly ended. As a result, the members of a scientific \ncommunity see themselves and are seen by others as the men uniquely \nresponsible for the pursuit of a set of shared goals, including the training \nof their successors. Within such groups communication is relatively full \nand professional judgment relatively unanimous. Because the attention \nof different scientific communities is, on the other hand, focused on \ndifferent matters, professional communication across group lines is \nsometimes arduous, often results in misunderstanding, and may, if \npursued, evoke significant and previously unsuspected disagreement. \n\nCommunities in this sense exist, of course, at numerous levels The \nmost global is the community of all natural scientists. At an only slightly \nlower level the main scientific professional groups are communities: \nphysicists, chemists, astronomers, zoologists, and the like. For these \nmajor groupings, community membership is readily established except \nat the fringes. Subject of highest degree, membership in professional \nsocieties, and journals read are ordinarily more than sufficient. Similar \ntechniques will also isolate major subgroups: organic chemists, and \nperhaps protein chemists among them, solid-state and high-energy \nphysicists, radio astronomers, and so on. It is only at the next lower level \nthat empirical problems emerge. How, to take a contemporary example, \nwould one have isolated the phage group prior to its public acclaim? For \nthis purpose one must have recourse to attendance at special \nconferences, to the distri- \n \n177 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \nbutton of draft manuscripts or galley proofs prior to publication, and \nabove all to formal and informal communication networks including \nthose discovered in correspondence and in the linkages among \ncitations.6  I take it that the job can and will be done, at least for the \ncontemporary scene and the more recent parts of the historical. \nTypically it may yield communities of perhaps one hundred members, \noccasionally significantly fewer. Usually individual scientists, \nparticularly the ablest, will belong to several such groups either \nsimultaneously or in succession. \n\nCommunities of this sort are the units that this book has presented as \nthe producers and validators of scientific knowledge. Paradigms are \nsomething shared by the members of such groups. Without reference to \nthe nature of these shared elements, many aspects of science described \nin the preceding pages can scarcely be understood. But other aspects \ncan, though they are not independently presented in my original text. It \nis therefore worth noting, before turning to paradigms directly, a series \nof issues that require reference to community structure alone. \n\nProbably the most striking of these is what I have previously called \nthe transition from the pre- to the post-paradigm period in the \ndevelopment of a scientific field. That transition is the one sketched \nabove in Section II. Before it occurs, a number of schools compete for \nthe domination of a given field. Afterward, in the wake of some notable \nscientific achievement, the number of schools is greatly reduced, \nordinarily to one, and a more efficient mode of scientific practice begins. \nThe latter is generally esoteric and oriented to puzzle-solving, as the \nwork of a group can be only when its members take the foundations of \ntheir field for granted. \n\nThe nature of that transition to maturity deserves fuller discussion \nthan it has received in this book, particularly from those concerned with \nthe development of the contemporary social \n\n \n6 Eugene Garfield, The Use of Citation Data in Writing the History of Science \n(Philadelphia: Institute of Scientific Information, 1964); M. M. Kessler, \n\u201cComparison of the Results of Bibliographic Coupling and Analytic Subject \nIndexing,\u201d American  Documentation,  XVI   (1965),  223-33;   D.  J.  Price,  \n\u201cNetworks  of Scientific Papers,\u201d Science, CIL (1965), 510-15. \n \n178 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \nsciences. To that end it may help to point out that the transition need \nnot (I now think should not) be associated with the first acquisition of a \nparadigm. The members of all scientific communities, including the \nschools of the \u201cpre-paradigm\u201d period, share the sorts of elements which \nI have collectively labelled \u2018a paradigm.\u2019 What changes with the \ntransition to maturity is not the presence of a paradigm but rather its \nnature. Only after the change is normal puzzle-solving research possible. \nMany of the attributes of a developed science which I have above \nassociated with the acquisition of a paradigm I would therefore now \ndiscuss as consequences of the acquisition of the sort of paradigm that \nidentifies challenging puzzles, supplies clues to their solution, and \nguarantees that the truly clever practitioner will succeed. Only those \nwho have taken courage from observing that their own field (or school) \nhas paradigms are likely to feel that something important is sacrificed by \nthe change. \n\nA second issue, more important at least to historians, concerns this \nbook\u2019s implicit one-to-one identification of scientific communities with \nscientific subject matters. I have, that is, repeatedly acted as though, say, \n\u2018physical optics,\u2019 \u2018electricity,\u2019 and \u2018heat\u2019 must name scientific \ncommunities because they do name subject matters for research. The \nonly alternative my text has seemed to allow is that all these subjects \nhave belonged to the physics community. Identifications of that sort will \nnot, however, usually withstand examination, as my colleagues in \nhistory have repeatedly pointed out. There was, for example, no physics \ncommunity before the mid-nineteenth century, and it was then formed \nby the merger of parts of two previously separate communities, \nmathematics and natural philosophy (physique experimentale). What is \ntoday the subject matter for a single broad community has been \nvariously distributed among diverse communities in the past. Other \nnarrower subjects, for example heat and the theory of matter, have \nexisted for long periods without becoming the special province of any \nsingle scientific community. Both normal science and revolutions are, \nhowever, community-based activities. To discover and analyze them, one \nmust first unravel the changing community structure of the sciences \n \n179 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nover time. A paradigm governs, in the first instance, not a subject matter \nbut rather a group of practitioners. Any study of paradigm-directed or \nof paradigm-shattering research must begin by locating the responsible \ngroup or groups. \n\nWhen the analysis of scientific development is approached in that \nway, several difficulties which have been foci for critical attention are \nlikely to vanish. A number of commentators have, for example, used the \ntheory of matter to suggest that I drastically overstate the unanimity of \nscientists in their allegiance to a paradigm. Until comparatively recently, \nthey point out, those theories have been topics for continuing \ndisagreement and debate. I agree with the description but think it no \ncounterexample. Theories of matter were not, at least until about 1920, \nthe special province or the subject matter for any scientific community. \nInstead, they were tools for a large number of specialists\u2019 groups. \nMembers of different communities sometimes chose different tools and \ncriticized the choice made by others. Even more important, a theory of \nmatter is not the sort of topic on which the members of even a single \ncommunity must necessarily agree. The need for agreement depends on \nwhat it is the community does. Chemistry in the first half of the \nnineteenth century provides a case in point. Though several of the \ncommunity\u2019s fundamental tools\u2014constant proportion, multiple \nproportion, and combining weights\u2014had become common property as a \nresult of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory, it was quite possible for chemists, after \nthe event, to base their work on these tools and to disagree, sometimes \nvehemently, about the existence of atoms. \n\nSome other difficulties and misunderstandings will, I believe, be \ndissolved in the same way. Partly because of the examples I have chosen \nand partly because of my vagueness about the nature and size of the \nrelevant communities, a few readers of this book have concluded that \nmy concern is primarily or exclusively with major revolutions such as \nthose associated with Copernicus, Newton, Darwin, or Einstein. A \nclearer delineation of community structure should, however, help to \nenforce the rather different impression I have tried to create. A \nrevolution \n\n \n180 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nis for me a special sort of change involving a certain sort of \nreconstruction of group commitments. But it need not be a large \nchange, nor need it seem revolutionary to those outside a single \ncommunity, consisting perhaps of fewer than twenty-five people. It is \njust because this type of change, little recognized or discussed in the \nliterature of the philosophy of science, occurs so regularly on this \nsmaller scale that revolutionary, as against cumulative, change so badly \nneeds to be understood. \n\nOne last alteration, closely related to the preceding, may help to \nfacilitate that understanding. A number of critics have doubted whether \ncrisis, the common awareness that something has gone wrong, precedes \nrevolutions so invariably as I have implied in my original text. Nothing \nimportant to my argument depends, however, on crises\u2019 being an \nabsolute prerequisite to revolutions; they need only be the usual \nprelude, supplying, that is, a self-correcting mechanism which ensures \nthat the rigidity of normal science will not forever go unchallenged. \nRevolutions may also be induced in other ways, though I think they \nseldom are. In addition, I would now point out what the absence of an \nadequate discussion of community structure has obscured above: crises \nneed not be generated by the work of the community that experiences \nthem and that sometimes undergoes revolution as a result. New \ninstruments like the electron microscope or new laws like Maxwell\u2019s may \ndevelop in one specialty and their assimilation create crisis in another. \n\n \n2. Paradigms as the Constellation of Group Commitments \n\n \nTurn now to paradigms and ask what they can possibly be. My \n\noriginal text leaves no more obscure or important question. One \nsympathetic reader, who shares my conviction that \u2018paradigm\u2019 names \nthe central philosophical elements of the book, prepared a partial \nanalytic index and concluded that the term is used in at least twenty-two \ndifferent ways.7 Most of those differences are, I now think, due to \nstylistic inconsistencies (e.g., Newton\u2019s Laws are sometimes a paradigm, \nsometimes parts of a paradigm, and \n\n \n7 Masterman, op. cit. \n\n \n181 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nsometimes paradigmatic), and they can be eliminated with relative ease. \nBut, with that editorial work done, two very different usages of the term \nwould remain, and they require separation. The more global use is the \nsubject of this subsection; the other will be considered in the next. \n\nHaving isolated a particular community of specialists by techniques \nlike those just discussed, one may usefully ask: What do its members \nshare that accounts for the relative fulness of their professional \ncommunication and the relative unanimity of their professional \njudgments? To that question my original text licenses the answer, a \nparadigm or set of paradigms. But for this use, unlike the one to be \ndiscussed below, the term is inappropriate. Scientists themselves would \nsay they share a theory or set of theories, and I shall be glad if the term \ncan ultimately be recaptured for this use. As currently used in \nphilosophy of science, however, \u2018theory\u2019 connotes a structure far more \nlimited in nature and scope than the one required here. Until the term \ncan be freed from its current implications, it will avoid confusion to \nadopt another. For present purposes I suggest \u2018disciplinary matrix\u2019: \n\u2018disciplinary\u2019 because it refers to the common possession of the \npractitioners of a particular discipline; \u2018matrix\u2019 because it is composed of \nordered elements of various sorts, each requiring further specification. \nAll or most of the objects of group commitment that my original text \nmakes paradigms, parts of paradigms, or paradigmatic are constituents \nof the disciplinary matrix, and as such they form a whole and function \ntogether. They are, however, no longer to be discussed as though they \nwere all of a piece. I shall not here attempt an exhaustive list, but noting \nthe main sorts of components of a disciplinary matrix will both clarify \nthe nature of my present approach and simultaneously prepare for my \nnext main point. \n\nOne important sort of component I shall label \u2018symbolic \ngeneralizations,\u2019 having in mind those expressions, deployed without \nquestion or dissent by group members, which can readily be cast in a \nlogical form like (x)(y)(z) (x, y, z). They are the formal or the readily \nformalizable components of the disciplinary matrix. Sometimes they are \nfound already in sym- \n\n \n182 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nbolic form: f = ma or I = V/R. Others are ordinarily expressed in words: \n\u201celements combine in constant proportion by weight,\u201d or \u201caction equals \nreaction.\u201d If it were not for the general acceptance of expressions like \nthese, there would be no points at which group members could attach \nthe powerful techniques of logical and mathematical manipulation in \ntheir puzzle-solving enterprise. Though the example of taxonomy \nsuggests that normal science can proceed with few such expressions, the \npower of a science seems quite generally to increase with the number of \nsymbolic generalizations its practioners have at their disposal. These \ngeneralizations look like laws of nature, but their function for group \nmembers is not often that alone. Sometimes it is: for example the Joule-\nLenz Law, H \u2014 RI2. When that law was discovered, community members \nalready knew what H, R, and I stood for, and these generalizations \nsimply told them something about the behavior of heat, current, and \nresistance that they had not known before. But more often, as \ndiscussion earlier in the book indicates, symbolic generalizations \nsimultaneously serve a second function, one that is ordinarily sharply \nseparated in analyses by philosophers of science. Like f = ma or I = V/R, \nthey function in part as laws but also in part as definitions of some of \nthe symbols they deploy. Furthermore, the balance between their \ninseparable legislative and definitional force shifts over time. In another \ncontext these points would repay detailed analysis, for the nature of the \ncommitment to a law is very different from that of commitment to a \ndefinition. Laws are often corrigible piecemeal, but definitions, being \ntautologies, are not. For example, part of what the acceptance of Ohm\u2019s \nLaw demanded was a redefinition of both \u2018current\u2019 and \u2018resistance\u2019; if \nthose terms had continued to mean what they had meant before, Ohm\u2019s \nLaw could not have been right; that is why it was so strenuously opposed \nas, say, the Joule-Lenz Law was not.8 Probably that situation is typical. I \ncurrently suspect that \n \n8 For significant parts of this episode see: T. M. Brown, \u201cThe Electric Current in \nEarly Nineteenth-Century French Physics,\u201d Historical Studies in the Physical \nSciences, I (1969), 61-103, and Morton Schagrin, \u201cResistance to Ohm\u2019s Law,\u201d \nAmerican Journal of Physics, XXI (1963), 536-47. \n \n183 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nall revolutions involve, among other things, the abandonment of \ngeneralizations the force of which had previously been in some part that \nof tautologies. Did Einstein show that simultaneity was relative or did he \nalter the notion of simultaneity itself? Were those who heard paradox in \nthe phrase \u2018relativity of simultaneity\u2019 simply wrong? \n\nConsider next a second type of component of the disciplinary matrix, \none about which a good deal has been said in my original text under \nsuch rubrics as \u2018metaphysical paradigms\u2019 or \u2018the metaphysical parts of \nparadigms.\u2019 I have in mind shared commitments to such beliefs as: heat \nis the kinetic energy of the constituent parts of bodies; all perceptible \nphenomena are due to the interaction of qualitatively neutral atoms in \nthe void, or, alternatively, to matter and force, or to fields. Rewriting the \nbook now I would describe such commitments as beliefs in particular \nmodels, and I would expand the category models to include also the \nrelatively heuristic variety: the electric circuit may be regarded as a \nsteady-state hydrodynamic system; the molecules of a gas behave like \ntiny elastic billiard balls in random motion. Though the strength of \ngroup commitment varies, with non-trivial consequences, along the \nspectrum from heuristic to onto-logical models, all models have similar \nfunctions. Among other things they supply the group with preferred or \npermissible analogies and metaphors. By doing so they help to \ndetermine what will be accepted as an explanation and as a puzzle-\nsolution; conversely, they assist in the determination of the roster of \nunsolved puzzles and in the evaluation of the importance of each. Note, \nhowever, that the members of scientific communities may not have to \nshare even heuristic models, though they usually do so. I have already \npointed out that membership in the community of chemists during the \nfirst half of the nineteenth century did not demand a belief in atoms. \n\nA third sort of element in the disciplinary matrix I shall here describe \nas values. Usually they are more widely shared among different \ncommunities than either symbolic generalizations or models, and they \ndo much to provide a sense of community to natural scientists as a \nwhole. Though they function at all times, their particular importance \nemerges when the members of a \n \n184 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \nparticular community must identify crisis or, later, choose between \nincompatible ways of practicing their discipline. Probably the most \ndeeply held values concern predictions: they should be accurate; \nquantitative predictions are preferable to qualitative ones; whatever the \nmargin of permissible error, it should be consistently satisfied in a given \nfield; and so on. There are also, however, values to be used in judging \nwhole theories: they must, first and foremost, permit puzzle-formulation \nand solution; where possible they should be simple, self-consistent, and \nplausible, compatible, that is, with other theories currently deployed. (I \nnow think it a weakness of my original text that so little attention is \ngiven to such values as internal and external consistency in considering \nsources of crisis and factors in theory choice.) Other sorts of values exist \nas well\u2014for example, science should (or need not) be socially useful\u2014but \nthe preceding should indicate what I have in mind. \n\nOne aspect of shared values does, however, require particular \nmention. To a greater extent than other sorts of components of the \ndisciplinary matrix, values may be shared by men who differ in their \napplication. Judgments of accuracy are relatively, though not entirely, \nstable from one time to another and from one member to another in a \nparticular group. But judgments of simplicity, consistency, plausibility, \nand so on often vary greatly from individual to individual. What was for \nEinstein an insupportable inconsistency in the old quantum theory, one \nthat rendered the pursuit of normal science impossible, was for Bohr \nand others a difficulty that could be expected to work itself out by \nnormal means. Even more important, in those situations where values \nmust be applied, different values, taken alone, would often dictate \ndifferent choices. One theory may be more accurate but less consistent \nor plausible than another; again the old quantum theory provides an \nexample. In short, though values are widely shared by scientists and \nthough commitment to them is both deep and constitutive of science, \nthe application of values is sometimes considerably affected by the \nfeatures of individual personality and biography that differentiate the \nmembers of the group. \n\nTo many readers of the preceding chapters, this characteristic \n \n185 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nof the operation of shared values has seemed a major weakness of my \nposition. Because I insist that what scientists share is not sufficient to \ncommand uniform assent about such matters as the choice between \ncompeting theories or the distinction between an ordinary anomaly and \na crisis-provoking one, I am occasionally accused of glorifying \nsubjectivity and even irrationality.9 But that reaction ignores two \ncharacteristics displayed by value judgments in any field. First, shared \nvalues can be important determinants of group behavior even though \nthe members of the group do not all apply them in the same way. (If \nthat were not the case, there would be no special philosophic problems \nabout value theory or aesthetics.) Men did not all paint alike during the \nperiods when representation was a primary value, but the \ndevelopmental pattern of the plastic arts changed drastically when that \nvalue was abandoned.10 Imagine what would happen in the sciences if \nconsistency ceased to be a primary value. Second, individual variability \nin the application of shared values may serve functions essential to \nscience. The points at which values must be applied are invariably also \nthose at which risks must be taken. Most anomalies are resolved by \nnormal means; most proposals for new theories do prove to be wrong. If \nall members of a community responded to each anomaly as a source of \ncrisis or embraced each new theory advanced by a colleague, science \nwould cease. If, on the other hand, no one reacted to anomalies or to \nbrand-new theories in high-risk ways, there would be few or no \nrevolutions. In matters like these the resort to shared values rather than \nto shared rules governing individual choice may be the community\u2019s \nway of distributing risk and assuring the long-term success of its \nenterprise. \n\nTurn now to a fourth sort of element in the disciplinary matrix, not \nthe only other kind but the last I shall discuss here. For it the term \n\u2018paradigm\u2019 would be entirely appropriate, both philologi- \n\n \n9 See particularly: Dudley Shapere, \u201cMeaning and Scientific Change,\u201d in Mind \nand Cosmos: Essays in Contemporary Science and Philosophy, The University of \nPittsburgh Series in the Philosophy of Science, III (Pittsburgh, 1966), 41-85; Israel \nScheffler, Science and Subjectivity (New York, 1967); and the essays of Sir Karl \nPopper and Imre Lakatos in Growth of Knowledge. \n10 See the discussion at the beginning of Section XIII, above. \n \n186 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\ncally and autobiographically; this is the component of a group\u2019s shared \ncommitments which first led me to the choice of that word. Because the \nterm has assumed a life of its own, however, I shall here substitute \n\u2018exemplars.\u2019 By it I mean, initially, the concrete problem-solutions that \nstudents encounter from the start of their scientific education, whether \nin laboratories, on examinations, or at the ends of chapters in science \ntexts. To these shared examples should, however, be added at least some \nof the technical problem-solutions found in the periodical literature that \nscientists encounter during their post-educational research careers and \nthat also show them by example how their job is to be done. More than \nother sorts of components of the disciplinary matrix, differences \nbetween sets of exemplars provide the community fine-structure of \nscience. All physicists, for example, begin by learning the same \nexemplars: problems such as the inclined plane, the conical pendulum, \nand Keplerian orbits; instruments such as the vernier, the calorimeter, \nand the Wheat-stone bridge. As their training develops, however, the \nsymbolic generalizations they share are increasingly illustrated by \ndifferent exemplars. Though both solid-state and field-theoretic \nphysicists share the Schrodinger equation, only its more elementary \napplications are common to both groups. \n \n3. Paradigms as Shared Examples \n\n \nThe paradigm as shared example is the central element of what I now \n\ntake to be the most novel and least understood aspect of this book. \nExemplars will therefore require more attention than the other sorts of \ncomponents of the disciplinary matrix. Philosophers of science have not \nordinarily discussed the problems encountered by a student in \nlaboratories or in science texts, for these are thought to supply only \npractice in the application of what the student already knows. He \ncannot, it is said, solve problems at all unless he has first learned the \ntheory and some rules for applying it. Scientific knowledge is embedded \nin theory and rules; problems are supplied to gain facility in their \napplication. I have tried to argue, however, that this localization of \n\n \n187 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nthe cognitive content of science is wrong. After the student has done \nmany problems, he may gain only added facility by solving more. But at \nthe start and for some time after, doing problems is learning \nconsequential things about nature. In the absence of such exemplars, \nthe laws and theories he has previously learned would have little \nempirical content. \n\nTo indicate what I have in mind I revert briefly to symbolic \ngeneralizations. One widely shared example is Newton\u2019s Second Law of \nMotion, generally written as f = ma. The sociologist, say, or the linguist \nwho discovers that the corresponding expression is unproblematically \nuttered and received by the members of a given community will not, \nwithout much additional investigation, have learned a great deal about \nwhat either the expression or the terms in it mean, about how the \nscientists of the community attach the expression to nature. Indeed, the \nfact that they accept it without question and use it as a point at which to \nintroduce logical and mathematical manipulation does not of itself \nimply that they agree at all about such matters as meaning and \napplication. Of course they do agree to a considerable extent, or the fact \nwould rapidly emerge from their subsequent conversation. But one may \nwell ask at what point and by what means they have come to do so. How \nhave they learned, faced with a given experimental situation, to pick out \nthe relevant forces, masses, and accelerations? \n\nIn practice, though this aspect of the situation is seldom or never \nnoted, what students have to learn is even more complex than that. It is \nnot quite the case that logical and mathematical manipulation are \napplied directly to f = ma. That expression proves on examination to be \na law-sketch or a law-schema. As the student or the practicing scientist \nmoves from one problem situation to the next, the symbolic \ngeneralization to which such manipulations apply changes. For the case \n\nof free fall, f = ma becomes ; for the simple pendulum it is \n\ntransformed to ; for a pair of interacting harmonic \noscillators it becomes two equations, the first of which may be written \n\n \n188 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\n; and for more complex situations, such as \nthe gyroscope, it takes still other forms, the family resemblance of which \nto f = ma is still harder to discover. Yet, while learning to identify forces, \nmasses, and accelerations in a variety of physical situations not \npreviously encountered, the student has also learned to design the \nappropriate version of f = ma through which to interrelate them, often a \nversion for which he has encountered no literal equivalent before. How \nhas he learned to do this? \n\nA phenomenon familiar to both students of science and historians of \nscience provides a clue. The former regularly report that they have read \nthrough a chapter of their text, understood it perfectly, but nonetheless \nhad difficulty solving a number of the problems at the chapter\u2019s end. \nOrdinarily, also, those difficulties dissolve in the same way. The student \ndiscovers, with or without the assistance of his instructor, a way to see \nhis problem as like a problem he has already encountered. Having seen \nthe resemblance, grasped the analogy between two or more distinct \nproblems, he can interrelate symbols and attach them to nature in the \nways that have proved effective before. The law-sketch, say f = ma, has \nfunctioned as a tool, informing the student what similarities to look for, \nsignaling the gestalt in which the situation is to be seen. The resultant \nability to see a variety of situations as like each other, as subjects for f = \nma or some other symbolic generalization, is, I think, the main thing a \nstudent acquires by doing exemplary problems, whether with a pencil \nand paper or in a well-designed laboratory. After he has completed a \ncertain number, which may vary widely from one individual to the next, \nhe views the situations that confront him as a scientist in the same \ngestalt as other members of his specialists\u2019 group. For him they are no \nlonger the same situations he had encountered when his training began. \nHe has meanwhile assimilated a time-tested and group-licensed way of \nseeing. \n\nThe role of acquired similarity relations also shows clearly in the \nhistory of science. Scientists solve puzzles by modeling them on \nprevious puzzle-solutions, often with only minimal recourse \n\n \n189 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nto symbolic generalizations. Galileo found that a ball rolling down an \nincline acquires just enough velocity to return it to the same vertical \nheight on a second incline of any slope, and he learned to see that \nexperimental situation as like the pendulum with a point-mass for a bob. \nHuyghens then solved the problem of the center of oscillation of a \nphysical pendulum by imagining that the extended body of the latter \nwas composed of Galilean point-pendula, the bonds between which \ncould be instantaneously released at any point in the swing. After the \nbonds were released, the individual point-pendula would swing freely, \nbut their collective center of gravity when each attained its highest point \nwould, like that of Galileo\u2019s pendulum, rise only to the height from \nwhich the center of gravity of the extended pendulum had begun to fall. \nFinally, Daniel Bernoulli discovered how to make the flow of water from \nan orifice resemble Huyghens\u2019 pendulum. Determine the descent of the \ncenter of gravity of the water in tank and jet during an infinitesimal \ninterval of time. Next imagine that each particle of water afterward \nmoves separately upward to the maximum height attainable with the \nvelocity acquired during that interval. The ascent of the center of \ngravity of the individual particles must then equal the descent of the \ncenter of gravity of the water in tank and jet. From that view of the \nproblem the long-sought speed of efflux followed at once.11 \n\nThat example should begin to make clear what I mean by learning \nfrom problems to see situations as like each other, as subjects for the \napplication of the same scientific law or law-sketch. Simultaneously it \nshould show why I refer to the consequential knowledge of nature \nacquired while learning the similarity relationship and thereafter \nembodied in a way of viewing \n\n \n11 For the example, see: Ren\u00e9 Dugas, A History of Mechanics, trans. J. R. Maddox \n(Neuchatel, 1955), pp. 135-36, 186-93, and Daniel Bernoulli, Hydro-dynamica, sive \nde viribus et motibus fluidorum, commentarii opus academicum (Strasbourg, 1738), \nSec. iii. For the extent to which mechanics progressed during the first half of the \neighteenth century by modelling one problem-solution on another, see Clifford \nTruesdell, \u201cReactions of Late Baroque Mechanics to Success, Conjecture, Error, \nand Failure in Newton\u2019s Principia,\u201d Texas Quarterly, X (1967), 238-58. \n \n190 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nphysical situations rather than in rules or laws. The three problems in \nthe example, all of them exemplars for eighteenth-century \nmechanicians, deploy only one law of nature. Known as the Principle of \nvis viva, it was usually stated as: \u201cActual descent equals potential ascent.\u201d \nBernoulli\u2019s application of the law should suggest how consequential it \nwas. Yet the verbal statement of the law, taken by itself, is virtually \nimpotent. Present it to a contemporary student of physics, who knows \nthe words and can do all these problems but now employs different \nmeans. Then imagine what the words, though all well known, can have \nsaid to a man who did not know even the problems. For him the \ngeneralization could begin to function only when he learned to \nrecognize \u201cactual descents\u201d and \u201cpotential ascents\u201d as ingredients of \nnature, and that is to learn something, prior to the law, about the \nsituations that nature does and does not present. That sort of learning is \nnot acquired by exclusively verbal means. Rather it comes as one is \ngiven words together with concrete examples of how they function in \nuse; nature and words are learned together. To borrow once more \nMichael Polanyi\u2019s useful phrase, what results from this process is \u201ctacit \nknowledge\u201d which is learned by doing science rather than by acquiring \nrules for doing it. \n \n4. Tacit Knowledge and Intuition \n \n\nThat reference to tacit knowledge and the concurrent rejection of \nrules isolates another problem that has bothered many of my critics and \nseemed to provide a basis for charges of subjectivity and irrationality. \nSome readers have felt that I was trying to make science rest on \nunanalyzable individual intuitions rather than on logic and law. But that \ninterpretation goes astray in two essential respects. First, if I am talking \nat all about intuitions, they are not individual. Rather they are the \ntested and shared possessions of the members of a successful group, and \nthe novice acquires them through training as a part of his preparation \nfor group-membership. Second, they are not in principle unanalyzable. \nOn the contrary, I am currently experimenting with a \n\n \n191 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\ncomputer program designed to investigate their properties at an \nelementary level. \n\nAbout that program I shall have nothing to say here,12 but even \nmention of it should make my most essential point. When I speak of \nknowledge embedded in shared exemplars, I am not referring to a mode \nof knowing that is less systematic or less analyzable than knowledge \nembedded in rules, laws, or criteria of identification. Instead I have in \nmind a manner of knowing which is miscontrued if reconstructed in \nterms of rules that are first abstracted from exemplars and thereafter \nfunction in their stead. Or, to put the same point differently, when I \nspeak of acquiring from exemplars the ability to recognize a given \nsituation as like some and unlike others that one has seen before, I am \nnot suggesting a process that is not potentially fully explicable in terms \nof neuro-cerebral mechanism. Instead I am claiming that the explication \nwill not, by its nature, answer the question, \u201cSimilar with respect to \nwhat?\u201d That question is a request for a rule, in this case for the criteria \nby which particular situations are grouped into similarity sets, and I am \narguing that the temptation to seek criteria (or at least a full set) should \nbe resisted in this case. It is not, however, system but a particular sort of \nsystem that I am opposing. \n\nTo give that point substance, I must briefly digress. What follows \nseems obvious to me now, but the constant recourse in my original text \nto phrases like \u201cthe world changes\u201d suggests that it has not always been \nso. If two people stand at the same place and gaze in the same direction, \nwe must, under pain of solipsism, conclude that they receive closely \nsimilar stimuli. (If both could put their eyes at the same place, the \nstimuli would be identical.) But people do not see stimuli; our \nknowledge of them is highly theoretical and abstract. Instead they have \nsensations, and we are under no compulsion to suppose that the \nsensations of our two viewers are the same. (Sceptics might remember \nthat color blindness was nowhere noticed until John Dalton\u2019s description \nof it in 1794.)   On the contrary, much \n\n \n12 Some information on this subject can be found in \u201cSecond Thoughts,\u201d \n\n \n192 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nneural processing takes place between the receipt of a stimulus and the \nawareness of a sensation. Among the few things that we know about it \nwith assurance are: that very different stimuli can produce the same \nsensations; that the same stimulus can produce very different \nsensations; and, finally, that the route from stimulus to sensation is in \npart conditioned by education. Individuals raised in different societies \nbehave on some occasions as though they saw different things. If we \nwere not tempted to identify stimuli one-to-one with sensations, we \nmight recognize that they actually do so. \n\nNotice now that two groups, the members of which have \nsystematically different sensations on receipt of the same stimuli, do in \nsome sense live in different worlds. We posit the existence of stimuli to \nexplain our perceptions of the world, and we posit their immutability to \navoid both individual and social solipsism. About neither posit have I \nthe slightest reservation. But our world is populated in the first instance \nnot by stimuli but by the objects of our sensations, and these need not \nbe the same, individual to individual or group to group. To the extent, of \ncourse, that individuals belong to the same group and thus share \neducation, language, experience, and culture, we have good reason to \nsuppose that their sensations are the same. How else are we to \nunderstand the fulness of their communication and the communality of \ntheir behavioral responses to their environment? They must see things, \nprocess stimuli, in much the same ways. But where the differentiation \nand specialization of groups begins, we have no similar evidence for the \nimmutability of sensation. Mere parochialism, I suspect, makes us \nsuppose that the route from stimuli to sensation is the same for the \nmembers of all groups. \n\nReturning now to exemplars and rules, what I have been trying to \nsuggest, in however preliminary a fashion, is this. One of the \nfundamental techniques by which the members of a group, whether an \nentire culture or a specialists\u2019 sub-community within it, learn to see the \nsame things when confronted with the same stimuli is by being shown \nexamples of situations that their predecessors in the group have already \nlearned to see as like \n\n \n193 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\neach other and as different from other sorts of situations. These similar \nsituations may be successive sensory presentations of the same \nindividual\u2014say of mother, who is ultimately recognized on sight as what \nshe is and as different from father or sister. They may be presentations \nof the members of natural families, say of swans on the one hand and of \ngeese on the other. Or they may, for the members of more specialized \ngroups, be examples of the Newtonian situation, of situations, that is, \nthat are alike in being subject to a version of the symbolic form f = ma \nand that are different from those situations to which, for example, the \nlaw-sketches of optics apply. \n\nGrant for the moment that something of this sort does occur. Ought \nwe say that what has been acquired from exemplars is rules and the \nability to apply them? That description is tempting because our seeing a \nsituation as like ones we have encountered before must be the result of \nneural processing, fully governed by physical and chemical laws. In this \nsense, once we have learned to do it, recognition of similarity must be as \nfully systematic as the beating of our hearts. But that very parallel \nsuggests that recognition may also be involuntary, a process over which \nwe have no control. If it is, then we may not properly conceive it as \nsomething we manage by applying rules and criteria. To speak of it in \nthose terms implies that we have access to alternatives, that we might, \nfor example, have disobeyed a rule, or misapplied a criterion, or \nexperimented with some other way of seeing.13 Those, I take it, are just \nthe sorts of things we cannot do. \n\nOr, more precisely, those are things we cannot do until after we have \nhad a sensation, perceived something. Then we do often seek criteria \nand put them to use. Then we may engage in interpretation, a \ndeliberative process by which we choose among alternatives as we do \nnot in perception itself. Perhaps, for example, something is odd about \nwhat we have seen (remember the anomalous playing cards). Turning a \ncorner we see mother \n\n \n13 This point might never have needed making if all laws were like Newton\u2019s and \nall rules like the Ten Commandments. In that case the phrase \u2018breaking a law\u2019 \nwould be nonsense, and a rejection of rules would not seem to imply a process \nnot governed by law. Unfortunately, traffic laws and similar products of \nlegislation can be broken, which makes the confusion easy. \n\n \n194 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nentering a downtown store at a time we had thought she was home. \nContemplating what we have seen we suddenly exclaim, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t \nmother, for she has red hair I\u201d Entering the store we see the woman \nagain and cannot understand how she could have been taken for \nmother. Or, perhaps we see the tail feathers of a waterfowl feeding from \nthe bottom of a shallow pool. Is it a swan or a goose? We contemplate \nwhat we have seen, mentally comparing the tail feathers with those of \nswans and geese we have seen before. Or, perhaps, being proto-scientists, \nwe simply want to know some general characteristic (the whiteness of \nswans, for example) of the members of a natural family we can already \nrecognize with ease. Again, we contemplate what we have previously \nperceived, searching for what the members of the given family have in \ncommon. \n\nThese are all deliberative processes, and in them we do seek and \ndeploy criteria and rules. We try, that is, to interpret sensations already \nat hand, to analyze what is for us the given. However we do that, the \nprocesses involved must ultimately be neural, and they are therefore \ngoverned by the same physico-chemical laws that govern perception on \nthe one hand and the beating of our hearts on the other. But the fact \nthat the system obeys the same laws in all three cases provides no \nreason to suppose that our neural apparatus is programmed to operate \nthe same way in interpretation as in perception or in either as in the \nbeating of our hearts. What I have been opposing in this book is \ntherefore the attempt, traditional since Descartes bat not before, to \nanalyze perception as an interpretive process, as an unconscious version \nof what we do after we have perceived. \n\nWhat makes the integrity of perception worth emphasizing is, of \ncourse, that so much past experience is embodied in the neural \napparatus that transforms stimuli to sensations. An appropriately \nprogrammed perceptual mechanism has survival value. To say that the \nmembers of different groups may have different perceptions when \nconfronted with the same stimuli is not to imply that they may have just \nany perceptions at all. In many environments a group that could not tell \nwolves from dogs could not endure. Nor would a group of nuclear \nphysicists today survive as scien- \n\n \n195 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\ntists if unable to recognize the tracks of alpha particles and electrons. It \nis just because so very few ways of seeing will do that the ones that have \nwithstood the tests of group use are worth transmitting from generation \nto generation. Equally, it is because they have been selected for their \nsuccess over historic time that we must speak of the experience and \nknowledge of nature embedded in the stimulus-to-sensation route. \n\nPerhaps \u2018knowledge\u2019 is the wrong word, but there are reasons for \nemploying it. What is built into the neural process that transforms \nstimuli to sensations has the following characteristics: it has been \ntransmitted through education; it has, by trial, been found more \neffective than its historical competitors in a group\u2019s current \nenvironment; and, finally, it is subject to change both through further \neducation and through the discovery of misfits with the environment. \nThose are characteristics of knowledge, and they explain why I use the \nterm. But it is strange usage, for one other characteristic is missing. We \nhave no direct access to what it is we know, no rules or generalizations \nwith which to express this knowledge. Rules which could supply that \naccess would refer to stimuli not sensations, and stimuli we can know \nonly through elaborate theory. In its absence, the knowledge embedded \nin the stimulus-to-sensation route remains tacit. \n\nThough it is obviously preliminary and need not be correct in all \ndetails, what has just been said about sensation is meant literally. At the \nvery least it is a hypothesis about vision which should be subject to \nexperimental investigation though probably not to direct check. But talk \nlike this of seeing and sensation here also serves metaphorical functions \nas it does in the body of the book. We do not see electrons, but rather \ntheir tracks or else bubbles of vapor in a cloud chamber. We do not see \nelectric currents at all, but rather the needle of an ammeter or \ngalvanometer. Yet in the preceding pages, particularly in Section X, I \nhave repeatedly acted as though we did perceive theoretical entities like \ncurrents, electrons, and fields, as though we learned to do so from \nexamination of exemplars, and as though in these cases too it would be \nwrong to replace talk of seeing with talk of criteria and interpretation. \nThe metaphor that transfers \u2018seeing\u2019 \n\n \n196 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nto contexts like these is scarcely a sufficient basis for such claims. In the \nlong run it will need to be eliminated in favor of a more literal mode of \ndiscourse. \n\nThe computer program referred to above begins to suggest ways in \nwhich that may be done, but neither available space nor the extent of \nmy present understanding permits my eliminating the metaphor here.14 \nInstead I shall try briefly to bulwark it. Seeing water droplets or a needle \nagainst a numerical scale is a primitive perceptual experience for the \nman unacquainted with cloud chambers and ammeters. It thus requires \ncontemplation, analysis, and interpretation (or else the intervention of \nexternal authority) before conclusions can be reached about electrons or \ncurrents. But the position of the man who has learned about these \ninstruments and had much exemplary experience with them is very \ndifferent, and there are corresponding differences in the way he \nprocesses the stimuli that reach him from them. Regarding the vapor in \nhis breath on a cold winter afternoon, his sensation may be the same as \nthat of a layman, but viewing a cloud chamber he sees (here literally) \nnot droplets but the tracks of electrons, alpha particles, and so on. Those \ntracks are, if you will, criteria that he interprets as indices of the \npresence of the corresponding particles, but that route is both shorter \nand different from the one taken by the man who interprets droplets. \n\nOr consider the scientist inspecting an ammeter to determine the \nnumber against which the needle has settled. His sensation probably is \nthe same as the layman\u2019s, particularly if the latter has \n\n \n14 For readers of \u201cSecond Thoughts\u201d the following cryptic remarks may be \nleading. The possibility of immediate recognition of the members of natural \nfamilies depends upon the existence, after neural processing, of empty \nperceptual space between the families to be discriminated. If, for example, there \nwere a perceived continuum of waterfowl ranging from geese to swans, we should \nbe compelled to introduce a specific criterion for distinguishing them. A similar \npoint can be made for unobservable entities. If a physical theory admits the \nexistence of nothing else like an electric current, then a small number of criteria, \nwhich may vary considerably from case to case, will suffice to identify currents \neven though there is no set of rules that specifies the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for the identification. That point suggests a plausible corollary which \nmay be more important. Given a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for \nidentifying a theoretical entity, that entity can be eliminated from the ontology of \na theory by substitution. In the absence of such rules, however, these entities are \nnot eliminable; the theory then demands their existence. \n \n197 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \nread other sorts of meters before. But he has seen the meter (again often \nliterally) in the context of the entire circuit, and he knows something \nabout its internal structure. For him the needle\u2019s position is a criterion, \nbut only of the value of the current. To interpret it he need determine \nonly on which scale the meter is to be read. For the layman, on the other \nhand, the needle\u2019s position is not a criterion of anything except itself. To \ninterpret it, he must examine the whole layout of wires, internal and \nexternal, experiment with batteries and magnets, and so on. In the \nmetaphorical no less than in the literal use of \u2018seeing,\u2019 interpretation \nbegins where perception ends. The two processes are not the same, and \nwhat perception leaves for interpretation to complete depends \ndrastically on the nature and amount of prior experience and training. \n\n \n5. Exemplars, Incommensurability, and Revolutions \n\n \nWhat has just been said provides a basis for clarifying one more \n\naspect of the book: my remarks on incommensurability and its \nconsequences for scientists debating the choice between successive \ntheories,15 In Sections X and XIII have argued that the parties to such \ndebates inevitably see differently certain of the experimental or \nobservational situations to which both have recourse. Since the \nvocabularies in which they discuss such situations consist, however, \npredominantly of the same terms, they must be attaching some of those \nterms to nature differently, and their communication is inevitably only \npartial. As a result, the superiority of one theory to another is something \nthat cannot be proved in the debate. Instead, I have insisted, each party \nmust try, by persuasion, to convert the other. Only philosophers have \nseriously misconstrued the intent of these parts of my argument. A \nnumber of them, however, have reported that I believe the following:16 \nthe proponents of incommensurable theories \n\n \n15 The points that follow are dealt with in more detail in Secs. v and vi of \n\u201cReflections.\u201d \n16 See the works cited in note 9, above, and also the essay by Stephen Toubmin \nin Growth of Knowledge. \n \n198 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \ncannot communicate with each other at all; as a result, in a debate over \ntheory-choice there can be no recourse to good reasons; instead theory \nmust be chosen for reasons that are ultimately personal and subjective; \nsome sort of mystical apperception is responsible for the decision \nactually reached. More than any other parts of the book, the passages on \nwhich these misconstructions rest have been responsible for charges of \nirrationality. \n\nConsider first my remarks on proof. The point I have been trying to \nmake is a simple one, long familiar in philosophy of science. Debates \nover theory-choice cannot be cast in a form that fully resembles logical \nor mathematical proof. In the latter, premises and rules of inference are \nstipulated from the start. If there is disagreement about conclusions, the \nparties to the ensuing debate can retrace their steps one by one, \nchecking each against prior stipulation. At the end of that process one or \nthe other must concede that he has made a mistake, violated a \npreviously accepted rule. After that concession he has no recourse, and \nhis opponent\u2019s proof is then compelling. Only if the two discover instead \nthat they differ about the meaning or application of stipulated rules, \nthat their prior agreement provides no sufficient basis for proof, does \nthe debate continue in the form it inevitably takes during scientific \nrevolutions. That debate is about premises, and its recourse is to \npersuasion as a prelude to the possibility of proof. \n\nNothing about that relatively familiar thesis implies either that there \nare no good reasons for being persuaded or that those reasons are not \nultimately decisive for the group. Nor does it even imply that the \nreasons for choice are different from those usually listed by \nphilosophers of science: accuracy, simplicity, fruitfulness, and the like. \nWhat it should suggest, however, is that such reasons function as values \nand that they can thus be differently applied, individually and \ncollectively, by men who concur in honoring them. If two men disagree, \nfor example, about the relative fruitfulness of their theories, or if they \nagree about that but disagree about the relative importance of \nfruitfulness and, say, scope in reaching a choice, neither can be con- \n \n199 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nvicted of a mistake. Nor is either being unscientific. There is no neutral \nalgorithm for theory-choice, no systematic decision procedure which, \nproperly applied, must lead each individual in the group to the same \ndecision. In this sense it is the community of specialists rather than its \nindividual members that makes the effective decision. To understand \nwhy science develops as it does, one need not unravel the details of \nbiography and personality that lead each individual to a particular \nchoice, though that topic has vast fascination. What one must \nunderstand, however, is the manner in which a particular set of shared \nvalues interacts with the particular experiences shared by a community \nof specialists to ensure that most members of the group will ultimately \nfind one set of arguments rather than another decisive. \n\nThat process is persuasion, but it presents a deeper problem. Two \nmen who perceive the same situation differently but nevertheless \nemploy the same vocabulary in its discussion must be using words \ndifferently. They speak, that is, from what I have called \nincommensurable viewpoints. How can they even hope to talk together \nmuch less to be persuasive. Even a preliminary answer to that question \ndemands further specification of the nature of the difficulty. I suppose \nthat, at least in part, it takes the following form. \n\nThe practice of normal science depends on the ability, acquired from \nexemplars, to group objects and situations into similarity sets which are \nprimitive in the sense that the grouping is done without an answer to \nthe question, \u201cSimilar with respect to what?\u201d One central aspect of any \nrevolution is, then, that some of the similarity relations change. Objects \nthat were grouped in the same set before are grouped in different ones \nafterward and vice versa. Think of the sun, moon, Mars, and earth \nbefore and after Copernicus; of free fall, pendular, and planetary motion \nbefore and after Galileo; or of salts, alloys, and a sulphur-iron filing mix \nbefore and after Dalton. Since most objects within even the altered sets \ncontinue to be grouped together, the names of the sets are usually \npreserved. Nevertheless, the transfer of a subset is ordinarily part of a \ncritical change in the network of interrelations among them.  \nTransferring the \n\n \n200 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nmetals from the set of compounds to the set of elements played an \nessential role in the emergence of a new theory of combustion, of \nacidity, and of physical and chemical combination. In short order those \nchanges had spread through all of chemistry. Not surprisingly, therefore, \nwhen such redistributions occur, two men whose discourse had \npreviously proceeded with apparently full understanding may suddenly \nfind themselves responding to the same stimulus with incompatible \ndescriptions and generalizations. Those difficulties will not be felt in all \nareas of even their scientific discourse, but they will arise and will then \ncluster most densely about the phenomena upon which the choice of \ntheory most centrally depends. \n\nSuch problems, though they first become evident in communication, \nare not merely linguistic, and they cannot be resolved simply by \nstipulating the definitions of troublesome terms. Because the words \nabout which difficulties cluster have been learned in part from direct \napplication to exemplars, the participants in a communication \nbreakdown cannot say, \u201cI use the word \u2018element\u2019 (or \u2018mixture,\u2019 or \n\u2018planet,\u2019 or \u2018unconstrained motion\u2019) in ways determined by the following \ncriteria.\u201d They cannot, that is, resort to a neutral language which both \nuse in the same way and which is adequate to the statement of both \ntheir theories or even of both those theories\u2019 empirical consequences. \nPart of the difference is prior to the application of the languages in \nwhich it is nevertheless reflected. \n\nThe men who experience such communication breakdowns must, \nhowever, have some recourse. The stimuli that impinge upon them are \nthe same. So is their general neural apparatus, however differently \nprogrammed. Furthermore, except in a small, if all-important, area of \nexperience even their neural programming must be very nearly the \nsame, for they share a history, except the immediate past. As a result, \nboth their everyday and most of their scientific world and language are \nshared. Given that much in common, they should be able to find out a \ngreat deal about how they differ. The techniques required are not, \nhowever, either straightforward, or comfortable, or parts of the \nscientist\u2019s normal arsenal. Scientists rarely recognize them \n\n \n201 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nfor quite what they are, and they seldom use them for longer than is \nrequired to induce conversion or convince themselves that it will not be \nobtained. \n\nBriefly put, what the participants in a communication breakdown can \ndo is recognize each other as members of different language \ncommunities and then become translators.17 Taking the differences \nbetween their own intra- and inter-group discourse as itself a subject for \nstudy, they can first attempt to discover the terms and locutions that, \nused unproblematically within each community, are nevertheless foci of \ntrouble for inter-group discussions. (Locutions that present no such \ndifficulties may be homophonically translated.) Having isolated such \nareas of difficulty in scientific communication, they can next resort to \ntheir shared everyday vocabularies in an effort further to elucidate their \ntroubles. Each may, that is, try to discover what the other would see and \nsay when presented with a stimulus to which his own verbal response \nwould be different. If they can sufficiently refrain from explaining \nanomalous behavior as the consequence of mere error or madness, they \nmay in time become very good predictors of each other\u2019s behavior. Each \nwill have learned to translate the other\u2019s theory and its consequences \ninto his own language and simultaneously to describe in his language \nthe world to which that theory applies. That is what the historian of \nscience regularly does (or should) when dealing with out-of-date \nscientific theories. \n\nSince translation, if pursued, allows the participants in a \ncommunication breakdown to experience vicariously something of the \nmerits and defects of each other\u2019s points of view, it is a potent tool both \nfor persuasion and for conversion. But even persuasion need not \nsucceed, and, if it does, it need not be \n\n \n17 The already classic source for most of the relevant aspects of translation is W. V. \nO. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge, Mass., and New York, 1960), chaps, i and \nii. But Quine seems to assume that two men receiving the same stimulus must \nhave the same sensation and therefore has little to say about the extent to which \na translator must be able to describe the world to which the language being \ntranslated applies. For the latter point see, E. A. Nida, \u201cLinguistics and Ethnology \nin Translation Problems,\u201d in Del Hymes (ed.), Language and Culture in Society \n(New York, 1964), pp. 90-97. \n\n \n202 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\naccompanied or followed by conversion. The two experiences are not \nthe same, an important distinction that I have only recently fully \nrecognized. \n\nTo persuade someone is, I take it, to convince him that one\u2019s own view \nis superior and ought therefore supplant his own. That much is \noccasionally achieved without recourse to anything like translation. In \nits absence many of the explanations and problem-statements endorsed \nby the members of one scientific group will be opaque to the other. But \neach language community can usually produce from the start a few \nconcrete research results that, though describable in sentences \nunderstood in the same way by both groups, cannot yet be accounted \nfor by the other community in its own terms. If the new viewpoint \nendures for a time and continues to be fruitful, the research results \nverbalizable in this way are likely to grow in number. For some men \nsuch results alone will be decisive. They can say: I don\u2019t know how the \nproponents of the new view succeed, but I must learn; whatever they \nare doing, it is clearly right. That reaction comes particularly easily to \nmen just entering the profession, for they have not yet acquired the \nspecial vocabularies and commitments of either group. \n\nArguments statable in the vocabulary that both groups use in the \nsame way are not, however, usually decisive, at least not until a very late \nstage in the evolution of the opposing views. Among those already \nadmitted to the profession, few will be persuaded without some \nrecourse to the more extended comparisons permitted by translation. \nThough the price is often sentences of great length and complexity \n(think of the Proust-Berthollet controversy conducted without recourse \nto the term \u2018element\u2019), many additional research results can be \ntranslated from one community\u2019s language into the other\u2019s. As \ntranslation proceeds, furthermore, some members of each community \nmay also begin vicariously to understand how a statement previously \nopaque could seem an explanation to members of the opposing group. \nThe availability of techniques like these does not, of course, guarantee \npersuasion. For most people translation is a threatening process, and it \nis entirely foreign to normal science. \n\n \n203 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \nCounter-arguments are, in any case, always available, and no rules \n\nprescribe how the balance must be struck. Nevertheless, as argument \npiles on argument and as challenge after challenge is successfully met, \nonly blind stubbornness can at the end account for continued \nresistance. \n\nThat being the case, a second aspect of translation, long familiar to \nboth historians and linguists, becomes crucially important. To translate \na theory or worldview into one\u2019s own language is not to make it one\u2019s \nown. For that one must go native, discover that one is thinking and \nworking in, not simply translating out of, a language that was previously \nforeign. That transition is not, however, one that an individual may \nmake or refrain from making by deliberation and choice, however good \nhis reasons for wishing to do so. Instead, at some point in the process of \nlearning to translate, he finds that the transition has occurred, that he \nhas slipped into the new language without a decision having been made. \nOr else, like many of those who first encountered, say, relativity or \nquantum mechanics in their middle years, he finds himself fully \npersuaded of the new view but nevertheless unable to internalize it and \nbe at home in the world it helps to shape. Intellectually such a man has \nmade his choice, but the conversion required if it is to be effective \neludes him. He may use the new theory nonetheless, but he will do so as \na foreigner in a foreign environment, an alternative available to him \nonly because there are natives already there. His work is parasitic on \ntheirs, for he lacks the constellation of mental sets which future \nmembers of the community will acquire through education. \n\nThe conversion experience that I have likened to a gestalt switch \nremains, therefore, at the heart of the revolutionary process. Good \nreasons for choice provide motives for conversion and a climate in \nwhich it is more likely to occur. Translation may, in addition, provide \npoints of entry for the neural reprogramming that, however inscrutable \nat this time, must underlie conversion. But neither good reasons nor \ntranslation constitute conversion, and it is that process we must \nexplicate in order to understand an essential sort of scientific change. \n\n \n204 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\n6. Revolutions and Relativism \n \nOne consequence of the position just outlined has particularly \n\nbothered a number of my critics.18 They find my viewpoint relativistic, \nparticularly as it is developed in the last section of this book. My \nremarks about translation highlight the reasons for the charge. The \nproponents of different theories are like the members of different \nlanguage-culture communities. Recognizing the parallelism suggests \nthat in some sense both groups may be right. Applied to culture and its \ndevelopment that position is relativistic. \n\nBut applied to science it may not be, and it is in any case far from \nmere relativism in a respect that its critics have failed to see. Taken as a \ngroup or in groups, practitioners of the developed sciences are, I have \nargued, fundamentally puzzle-solvers. Though the values that they \ndeploy at times of theory-choice derive from other aspects of their work \nas well, the demonstrated ability to set up and to solve puzzles \npresented by nature is, in case of value conflict, the dominant criterion \nfor most members of a scientific group. Like any other value, puzzle-\nsolving ability proves equivocal in application. Two men who share it \nmay nevertheless differ in the judgments they draw from its use. But the \nbehavior of a community which makes it preeminent will be very \ndifferent from that of one which does not. In the sciences, I believe, the \nhigh value accorded to puzzle-solving ability has the following \nconsequences. \n\nImagine an evolutionary tree representing the development of the \nmodern scientific specialties from their common origins in, say, \nprimitive natural philosophy and the crafts. A line drawn up that tree, \nnever doubling back, from the trunk to the tip of some branch would \ntrace a succession of theories related by descent. Considering any two \nsuch theories, chosen from points not too near their origin, it should be \neasy to design a list of criteria that would enable an uncommitted \nobserver to distinguish the earlier from the more recent theory time \nafter time. Among \n\n \n18 Shapere, \u201cStructure of Scientific Revolutions,\u201d and Popper in Growth of \nKnowledge. \n\n \n205 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nthe most useful would be: accuracy of prediction, particularly of \nquantitative prediction; the balance between esoteric and everyday \nsubject matter; and the number of different problems solved. Less \nuseful for this purpose, though also important determinants of scientific \nlife, would be such values as simplicity, scope, and compatibility with \nother specialties. Those lists are not yet the ones required, but I have no \ndoubt that they can be completed. If they can, then scientific \ndevelopment is, like biological, a unidirectional and irreversible process. \nLater scientific theories are better than earlier ones for solving puzzles \nin the often quite different environments to which they are applied. \nThat is not a relativist\u2019s position, and it displays the sense in which I am \na convinced believer in scientific progress. \n\nCompared with the notion of progress most prevalent among both \nphilosophers of science and laymen, however, this position lacks an \nessential element. A scientific theory is usually felt to be better than its \npredecessors not only in the sense that it is a better instrument for \ndiscovering and solving puzzles but also because it is somehow a better \nrepresentation of what nature is really like. One often hears that \nsuccessive theories grow ever closer to, or approximate more and more \nclosely to, the truth. Apparently generalizations like that refer not to the \npuzzle-solutions and the concrete predictions derived from a theory but \nrather to its ontology, to the match, that is, between the entities with \nwhich the theory populates nature and what is \u201creally there.\u201d \n\nPerhaps there is some other way of salvaging the notion of \u2018truth\u2019 for \napplication to whole theories, but this one will not do. There is, I think, \nno theory-independent way to reconstruct phrases like \u2018really there\u2019; the \nnotion of a match between the ontology of a theory and its \u201creal\u201d \ncounterpart in nature now seems to me illusive in principle. Besides, as \na historian, I am impressed with the implausability of the view. I do not \ndoubt, for example, that Newton\u2019s mechanics improves on Aristotle\u2019s \nand that Einstein\u2019s improves on Newton\u2019s as instruments for puzzle-\nsolving. But I can see in their succession no coherent direction of \nontological development. On the contrary, in some \n\n \n206 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nimportant respects, though by no means in all, Einstein\u2019s general theory \nof relativity is closer to Aristotle\u2019s than either of them is to Newton\u2019s. \nThough the temptation to describe that position as relativistic is \nunderstandable, the description seems to me wrong. Conversely, if the \nposition be relativism, I cannot see that the relativist loses anything \nneeded to account for the nature and development of the sciences. \n\n \n7.  The Nature of Science \n\n \nI conclude with a brief discussion of two recurrent reactions to my \n\noriginal text, the first critical, the second favorable, and neither, I think, \nquite right. Though the two relate neither to what has been said so far \nnor to each other, both have been sufficiently prevalent to demand at \nleast some response. \n\nA few readers of my original text have noticed that I repeatedly pass \nback and forth between the descriptive and the normative modes, a \ntransition particularly marked in occasional passages that open with, \n\u201cBut that is not what scientists do,\u201d and close by claiming that scientists \nought not do so. Some critics claim that I am confusing description with \nprescription, violating the time-honored philosophical theorem: \u2018Is\u2019 \ncannot imply \u2018ought.\u201919 \n\nThat theorem has, in practice, become a tag, and it is no longer \neverywhere honored. A number of contemporary philosophers have \ndiscovered important contexts in which the normative and the \ndescriptive are inextricably mixed.20 \u2018Is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019 are by no means \nalways so separate as they have seemed. But no recourse to the \nsubtleties of contemporary linguistic philosophy is needed to unravel \nwhat has seemed confused about this aspect of my position. The \npreceding pages present a viewpoint or theory about the nature of \nscience, and, like other philosophies of science, the theory has \nconsequences for the way in which scientists should behave if their \nenterprise is to succeed. Though \n\n \n19 For one of many examples, see P. K. Feyerabend\u2019s essay in Growth of Knowledge. \n20  Stanley Cavell, Must We Mean What We Say? (New York, 1969), chap, i. \n\n \n207 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\nit need not be right, any more than any other theory, it provides a \nlegitimate basis for reiterated \u2018oughts\u2019 and \u2018shoulds.\u2019 Conversely, one set \nof reasons for taking the theory seriously is that scientists, whose \nmethods have been developed and selected for their success, do in fact \nbehave as the theory says they should. My descriptive generalizations \nare evidence for the theory precisely because they can also be derived \nfrom it, whereas on other views of the nature of science they constitute \nanomalous behavior. \n\nThe circularity of that argument is not, I think, vicious. The \nconsequences of the viewpoint being discussed are not exhausted by the \nobservations upon which it rested at the start. Even before this book was \nfirst published, I had found parts of the theory it presents a useful tool \nfor the exploration of scientific behavior and development. Comparison \nof this postscript with the pages of the original may suggest that it has \ncontinued to play that role. No merely circular point of view can provide \nsuch guidance. \n\nTo one last reaction to this book, my answer must be of a different \nsort. A number of those who have taken pleasure from it have done so \nless because it illuminates science than because they read its main \ntheses as applicable to many other fields as well. I see what they mean \nand would not like to discourage their attempts to extend the position, \nbut their reaction has nevertheless puzzled me. To the extent that the \nbook portrays scientific development as a succession of tradition-bound \nperiods punctuated by non-cumulative breaks, its theses are \nundoubtedly of wide applicability. But they should be, for they are \nborrowed from other fields. Historians of literature, of music, of the arts, \nof political development, and of many other human activities have long \ndescribed their subjects in the same way. Periodization in terms of \nrevolutionary breaks in style, taste, and institutional structure have \nbeen among their standard tools. If I have been original with respect to \nconcepts like these, it has mainly been by applying them to the sciences, \nfields which had been widely thought to develop in a different way. \nConceivably the notion of a paradigm as a concrete achievement, an \nexemplar, is a second contribution. I suspect, for example, that some of \nthe notorious difficulties surrounding the notion of style in the \n\n \n208 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\narts may vanish if paintings can be seen to be modeled on one another \nrather than produced in conformity to some abstracted canons of \nstyle.21 \n\nThis book, however, was intended also to make another sort of point, \none that has been less clearly visible to many of its readers. Though \nscientific development may resemble that in other fields more closely \nthan has often been supposed, it is also strikingly different. To say, for \nexample, that the sciences, at least after a certain point in their \ndevelopment, progress in a way that other fields do not, cannot have \nbeen all wrong, whatever progress itself may be. One of the objects of \nthe book was to examine such differences and begin accounting for \nthem. \n\nConsider, for example, the reiterated emphasis, above, on the absence \nor, as I should now say, on the relative scarcity of competing schools in \nthe developed sciences. Or remember my remarks about the extent to \nwhich the members of a given scientific community provide the only \naudience and the only judges of that community\u2019s work. Or think again \nabout the special nature of scientific education, about puzzle-solving as \na goal, and about the value system which the scientific group deploys in \nperiods of crisis and decision. The book isolates other features of the \nsame sort, none necessarily unique to science but in conjunction setting \nthe activity apart. \n\nAbout all these features of science there is a great deal more to be \nlearned. Having opened this postscript by emphasizing the need to \nstudy the community structure of science, I shall close by underscoring \nthe need for similar and, above all, for comparative study of the \ncorresponding communities in other fields. How does one elect and how \nis one elected to membership in a particular community, scientific or \nnot? What is the process and what are the stages of socialization to the \ngroup? What does the group collectively see as its goals; what \ndeviations, individual or collective, will it tolerate; and how does it \ncontrol the impermissible aberration? A fuller understanding of science \nwill de- \n\n \n21 For this point as well as a more extended discussion of what is special about the \nsciences, see T. S. Kuhn, \u201cComment [on the Relations of Science and Art],\u201d \nComparative Studies in Philosophy and History, XI (1969), 403-12. \n\n \n209 \n\n\n\nPostscript \n \n\npend on answers to other sorts of questions as well, but there is no area \nin which more work is so badly needed. Scientific knowledge, like \nlanguage, is intrinsically the common property of a group or else \nnothing at all. To understand it we shall need to know the special \ncharacteristics of the groups that create and use it. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n210 \n\n\n"
